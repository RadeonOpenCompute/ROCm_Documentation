ROCmRDMA
=========
**Peer-to-Peer bridge driver for PeerDirect - Deprecated Repo**

This is now included as part of the ROCK `Kernel Driver <https://github.com/RadeonOpenCompute/ROCK-Kernel-Driver>`_
ROCmRDMA is the solution designed to allow third-party kernel drivers to utilize DMA access to the GPU  memory. It allows direct path for data exchange (peer-to-peer) using the standard features of PCI Express. 

Currently ROCmRDMA provides the following benefits:

 * Direct access to ROCm memory for 3rd party PCIe devices
 * Support for PeerDirect(c) interface to offloads the CPU when dealing 
   with ROCm memory for RDMA network stacks;

Restrictions and limitations
*****************************
To fully utilize ROCmRDMA  the number of limitation could apply impacting either performance or functionality in the whole:

 * It is recommended that devices utilizing ROCmRDMA share the same upstream PCI Express root complex. Such limitation depends on    	PCIe chipset manufacturses and outside of GPU controls;
 * To provide peer-to-peer DMA access all GPU local memory must be exposed via PCI memory BARs (so called large-BAR configuration);
 * It is recommended to have IOMMU support disabled or configured in pass-through mode due to limitation in Linux kernel to support  	local PCIe device memory for any form transition others then 1:1 mapping.

ROCmRDMA interface specification
*********************************
The implementation of ROCmRDMA interface can be found in `[amd_rdma.h] <https://github.com/RadeonOpenCompute/ROCK-Kernel-Driver/blob/master/include/drm/amd_rdma.h>`_ file.

API versions
************

ROCm up to and including v4.1 supported RDMA version 1.0. 

ROCm 4.2 has enhanced the API version to 2.0, introduced the following definitions to allow users to detect the API version, and apply conditional compilation as needed:

::

   /* API versions:
    * 1.0 Original API until ROCm 4.1, AMD_RDMA_MAJOR/MINOR undefined
    * 2.0 Added IOMMU (dma-mapping) support, removed p2p_info.kfd_proc
    *     Introduced AMD_RDMA_MAJOR/MINOR version definition
    */
   #define AMD_RDMA_MAJOR 2
   #define AMD_RDMA_MINOR 0

UCX
====

**What is UCX ?**

Unified Communication X (UCX) is a communication library for building Message Passing (MPI), PGAS/OpenSHMEM libraries and RPC/data-centric applications. UCX utilizes high-speed networks for inter-node and shared memory mechanisms for intra-node communication. For more information, visit http://openucx.github.io/ucx/

**How to install UCX with ROCm ?**

See `How to install UCX and OpenMPI <https://github.com/openucx/ucx/wiki/Build-and-run-ROCM-UCX-OpenMPI>`_


**How to enable ROCm transport during configuration and runtime**

Access the following links to enable ROCm transport during configuration and runtime:


* For release builds: ./contrib/configure-release --prefix=/path/to/install --with-rocm=/path/to/rocm

* For debug builds: ./contrib/configure-devel --prefix=/path/to/install --with-rocm=/path/to/rocm


OpenMPI
=========

**OpenMPI and OpenSHMEM installation**

1. Get latest-and-gratest OpenMPI version:
::
  $ git clone https://github.com/open-mpi/ompi.git

2. Autogen:
::
  $ cd ompi
  $ ./autogen.pl

3. Configure with UCX
::
  $ mkdir build
  $ cd build
  ../configure --prefix=/your_install_path/ --with-ucx=/path_to_ucx_installation

4. Build:
::
  $ make
  $ make install

**Running Open MPI with UCX**

Example of the command line (for InfiniBand RC + shared memory):

::
  
  $ mpirun -np 2 -mca pml ucx -x UCX_NET_DEVICES=mlx5_0:1 -x UCX_TLS=rc,sm ./app


**Open MPI runtime optimizations for UCX**

* By default OpenMPI enables build-in transports (BTLs), which may result in additional software overheads in the OpenMPI progress function. In order to workaround this issue you may try to disable certain BTLs.

::

  $ mpirun -np 2 -mca pml ucx --mca btl ^vader,tcp,openib -x UCX_NET_DEVICES=mlx5_0:1 -x UCX_TLS=rc,sm ./app

* OpenMPI version https://github.com/open-mpi/ompi/commit/066370202dcad8e302f2baf8921e9efd0f1f7dfc leverages more efficient timer mechanism and there fore reduces software overheads in OpenMPI progress

**Signal sharing API**

Client should call hsa_signal_destroy() when access to this resource is not needed any more.

**Query API**

| Query memory information

Allows query information about memory resource based on address. It is partially overlapped with the following requirement Memory info interface so it may be possible to merge those two interfaces.
::
 typedef enum hsa_amd_address_info_s {
     
     /* Return uint32_t  / boolean if address was allocated via  HSA stack */
     HSA_AMD_ADDRESS_HSA_ALLOCATED = 0x1,
