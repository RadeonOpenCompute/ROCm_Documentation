1. Overview
***********

| The rocProf is a command line tool implemented on the top of
  rocProfiler and rocTracer APIs. Source code for rocProf can be found
  at GitHub:
  `https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/rocprofiler/blob/amd-master/bin/rocprof <https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/rocprofiler/blob/amd-master/bin/rocprof>`__
| This command line tool is implemented as a script which is setting up
  the environment for attaching the profiler and then run the provided
  application command line. The tool uses two profiling plugins loaded
  by ROC runtime and based on rocProfiler and rocTracer for collecting
  metrics/counters, HW traces and runtime API/activity traces. The tool
  consumes an input XML or text file with counters list or trace
  parameters and provides output profiling data and statistics in
  various formats as text, CSV and JSON traces. Google Chrome tracing
  can be used to visualize the JSON traces with runtime API/activity
  timelines and per kernel counters data.

2. Profiling Modes
******************

‘rocprof’ can be used for GPU profiling using HW counters and
application tracing

2.1. GPU profiling
******************

GPU profiling is controlled with input file which defines a list of
metrics/counters and a profiling scope. An input file is provided using
option ‘-i ’. Output CSV file with a line per submitted kernel is
generated. Each line has kernel name, kernel parameters and counter
values. By option ‘—stats’ the kernel execution stats can be generated
in CSV format. Currently profiling has limitation of serializing
submitted kernels. An example of input file:

::

      # Perf counters group 1
      pmc : Wavefronts VALUInsts SALUInsts SFetchInsts
      # Perf counters group 2
      pmc : TCC_HIT[0], TCC_MISS[0]
      # Filter by dispatches range, GPU index and kernel names
      # supported range formats: "3:9", "3:", "3"
      range: 1 : 4
      gpu: 0 1 2 3
      kernel: simple Pass1 simpleConvolutionPass2

An example of profiling command line for ‘MatrixTranspose’ application

::

   $ rocprof -i input.txt MatrixTranspose
   RPL: on '191018_011134' from '/…./rocprofiler_pkg' in '/…./MatrixTranspose'

**2.1.1. Counters and metrics**

There are two profiling features, metrics and traces. Hardware
performance counters are treated as the basic metrics and the formulas
can be defined for derived metrics. Counters and metrics can be
dynamically configured using XML configuration files with counters and
metrics tables:

 - Counters table entry, basic metric: counter name, block name, event
   id
 - Derived metrics table entry: metric name, an expression for
   calculation the metric from the counters

Metrics XML File Example:

::

   <gfx8>
       <metric name=L1_CYCLES_COUNTER block=L1 event=0 descr=”L1 cache cycles”></metric>
       <metric name=L1_MISS_COUNTER block=L1 event=33 descr=”L1 cache misses”></metric>
       . . .
   </gfx8>

   <gfx9>
       . . .
   </gfx9>

   <global>
     <metric
       name=L1_MISS_RATIO
       expr=L1_CYCLES_COUNT/L1_MISS_COUNTER
       descry=”L1 miss rate metric”
     ></metric>
   </global>

**2.1.1.1. Metrics query**

Available counters and metrics can be queried by options ‘—list-basic’
for counters and ‘—list-derived’ for derived metrics. The output for
counters indicates number of block instances and number of block counter
registers. The output for derived metrics prints the metrics
expressions. Examples:

::

   $ rocprof --list-basic
   RPL: on '191018_014450' from '/opt/rocm/rocprofiler' in '/…./MatrixTranspose'
   ROCProfiler: rc-file '/…./rpl_rc.xml'
   Basic HW counters:
     gpu-agent0 : GRBM_COUNT : Tie High - Count Number of Clocks
         block GRBM has 2 counters
     gpu-agent0 : GRBM_GUI_ACTIVE : The GUI is Active
         block GRBM has 2 counters
         . . .
     gpu-agent0 : TCC_HIT[0-15] : Number of cache hits.
         block TCC has 4 counters
     gpu-agent0 : TCC_MISS[0-15] : Number of cache misses. UC reads count as misses.
         block TCC has 4 counters
         . . .

   $ rocprof --list-derived
   RPL: on '191018_015911' from '/opt/rocm/rocprofiler' in '/home/evgeny/work/BUILD/0_MatrixTranspose'
   ROCProfiler: rc-file '/home/evgeny/rpl_rc.xml'
   Derived metrics:
     gpu-agent0 : TCC_HIT_sum : Number of cache hits. Sum over TCC instances.
         TCC_HIT_sum = sum(TCC_HIT,16)
     gpu-agent0 : TCC_MISS_sum : Number of cache misses. Sum over TCC instances.
         TCC_MISS_sum = sum(TCC_MISS,16)
     gpu-agent0 : TCC_MC_RDREQ_sum : Number of 32-byte reads. Sum over TCC instaces.
         TCC_MC_RDREQ_sum = sum(TCC_MC_RDREQ,16)
       . . .

**2.1.1.2. Metrics collecting**

Counters and metrics accumulated per kernel can be collected using input
file with a list of metrics, see an example in 2.1. Currently profiling
has limitation of serializing submitted kernels. The number of counters
which can be dumped by one run is limited by GPU HW by number of counter
registers per block. The number of counters can be different for
different blocks and can be queried, see 2.1.1.1.

**2.1.1.2.1. Blocks instancing**

GPU blocks are implemented as several identical instances. To dump
counters of specific instance square brackets can be used, see an
example in 2.1. The number of block instances can be queried, see
2.1.1.1.

**2.1.1.2.2. HW limitations**

The number of counters which can be dumped by one run is limited by GPU
HW by number of counter registers per block. The number of counters can
be different for different blocks and can be queried, see 2.1.1.1.

 - Metrics groups

To dump a list of metrics exceeding HW limitations the metrics list can
be split on groups. The tool supports automatic splitting on optimal
metric groups:

::

   $ rocprof -i input.txt ./MatrixTranspose
   RPL: on '191018_032645' from '/opt/rocm/rocprofiler' in '/…./MatrixTranspose'
   RPL: profiling './MatrixTranspose'
   RPL: input file 'input.txt'
   RPL: output dir '/tmp/rpl_data_191018_032645_12106'
   RPL: result dir '/tmp/rpl_data_191018_032645_12106/input0_results_191018_032645'
   ROCProfiler: rc-file '/…./rpl_rc.xml'
   ROCProfiler: input from "/tmp/rpl_data_191018_032645_12106/input0.xml"
     gpu_index =
     kernel =
     range =
     20 metrics
       Wavefronts, VALUInsts, SALUInsts, SFetchInsts, FlatVMemInsts, LDSInsts, FlatLDSInsts, GDSInsts, VALUUtilization, FetchSize, WriteSize, L2CacheHit, VWriteInsts, GPUBusy, VALUBusy, SALUBusy, MemUnitStalled, WriteUnitStalled, LDSBankConflict, MemUnitBusy
     0 traces
   Device name Ellesmere [Radeon RX 470/480/570/570X/580/580X]

   Input metrics out of HW limit. Proposed metrics group set:
    group1: L2CacheHit VWriteInsts MemUnitStalled WriteUnitStalled MemUnitBusy FetchSize FlatVMemInsts LDSInsts VALUInsts SALUInsts SFetchInsts FlatLDSInsts GPUBusy Wavefronts
    group2: WriteSize GDSInsts VALUUtilization VALUBusy SALUBusy LDSBankConflict

   ERROR: rocprofiler_open(), Construct(), Metrics list exceeds HW limits

   Aborted (core dumped)
   Error found, profiling aborted.

________________________________

 - Collecting with multiple runs

To collect several metric groups a full application replay is used by
defining several ‘pmc:’ lines in the input file, see 2.1.


2.2. Application tracing
************************

Supported application tracing includes runtime API and GPU activity
tracing’ Supported runtimes are: ROCr (HSA API) and HIP Supported GPU
activity: kernel execution, async memory copy, barrier packets. The
trace is generated in JSON format compatible with Chrome tracing. The
trace consists of several sections with timelines for API trace per
thread and GPU activity. The timelines events show event name and
parameters. Supported options: ‘—hsa-trace’, ‘—hip-trace’, ‘—sys-trace’,
where ‘sys trace’ is for HIP and HSA combined trace.

**2.2.1. HIP runtime trace**

The trace is generated by option ‘—hip-trace’ and includes HIP API
timelines and GPU activity at the runtime level.

**2.2.2. ROCr runtime trace**

The trace is generated by option ‘—hsa-trace’ and includes ROCr API
timelines and GPU activity at AQL queue level. Also, can provide
counters per kernel.

**2.2.3. KFD driver trace**

The trace is generated by option ‘—kfd-trace’ and includes KFD Thunk API
timelines.

It is planned to include memory allocations/migration activity tracing.

**2.2.4. Code annotation**

Support for application code annotation. Start/stop API is supported to
programmatically control the profiling. A ‘roctx’ library provides
annotation API. Annotation is visualized in JSON trace as a separate
"Markers and Ranges" timeline section.

**2.2.4.1. Start/stop API**

::

   // Tracing start API
   void roctracer_start();

   // Tracing stop API
   void roctracer_stop();

**2.2.4.2. rocTX basic markers API**

::

   // A marker created by given ASCII message
   void roctxMark(const char* message);

   // Returns the 0 based level of a nested range being started by given message associated to this range.
   // A negative value is returned on the error.
   int roctxRangePush(const char* message);

   // Marks the end of a nested range.
   // Returns the 0 based level the range.
   // A negative value is returned on the error.
   int roctxRangePop();

**2.3. Multiple GPUs profiling**

The profiler supports multiple GPU’s profiling and provide GPI id for
counters and kernels data in CSV output file. Also, GPU id is indicating
for respective GPU activity timeline in JSON trace.

3. Profiling control
********************

Profiling can be controlled by specifying a profiling scope, by
filtering trace events and specifying interesting time intervals.

3.1. Profiling scope
********************

Counters profiling scope can be specified by GPU id list, kernel name
substrings list and dispatch range. Supported range formats examples:
"3:9", "3:", "3". You can see an example of input file in 2.1.

3.2. Tracing control
********************

Tracing can be filtered by events names using profiler input file and by
enabling interesting time intervals by command line option.

**3.2.1. Filtering traced APIs**

A list of traced API names can be specified in profiler input file. An
example of input file line for ROCr runtime trace (HAS API): hsa:
hsa_queue_create hsa_amd_memory_pool_allocate

**3.2.2. Tracing period**

Tracing can be disabled on start so it can be enabled with start/stop API:

::

   --trace-start <on|off>

Trace can be dumped periodically with initial delay, dumping period
length and rate:

::

   --trace-period <dealy:length:rate>

3.3. Concurrent kernels
***********************

Currently concurrent kernels profiling is not supported which is a
planned feature. Kernels are serialized.

3.4. Multi-processes profiling
******************************

Multi-processes profiling is not currently supported.

3.5. Errors logging
*******************

Profiler errors are logged to global logs:

::

   /tmp/aql_profile_log.txt
   /tmp/rocprofiler_log.txt
   /tmp/roctracer_log.txt

4. 3rd party visualization tools
********************************

‘rocprof’ is producing JSON trace compatible with Chrome Tracing, which
is an internal trace visualization tool in Google Chrome.

   •   SALUBusy : The percentage of GPUTime scalar ALU instructions are processed. Value range: 0% (bad) to 100% (optimal).
   •   Mem32Bwrites :
   •   FetchSize : The total kilobytes fetched from the video memory. This is measured with all extra fetches and any cache or memory effects taken into account.
   •   WriteSize : The total kilobytes written to the video memory. This is measured with all extra fetches and any cache or memory effects taken into account.
   •   L2CacheHit : The percentage of fetch, write, atomic, and other instructions that hit the data in L2 cache. Value range: 0% (no hit) to 100% (optimal).
   •   MemUnitBusy : The percentage of GPUTime the memory unit is active. The result includes the stall time (MemUnitStalled). This is measured with all extra fetches and writes and any cache or memory effects taken into account. Value range: 0% to 100% (fetch-bound).
   •   MemUnitStalled : The percentage of GPUTime the memory unit is stalled. Try reducing the number or size of fetches and writes if possible. Value range: 0% (optimal) to 100% (bad).
   •   WriteUnitStalled : The percentage of GPUTime the Write unit is stalled. Value range: 0% to 100% (bad).
   •   ALUStalledByLDS : The percentage of GPUTime ALU units are stalled by the LDS input queue being full or the output queue being not ready. If there are LDS bank conflicts, reduce them. Otherwise, try reducing the number of LDS accesses if possible. Value range: 0% (optimal) to 100% (bad).
   •   LDSBankConflict : The percentage of GPUTime LDS is stalled by bank conflicts. Value range: 0% (optimal) to 100% (bad).

AOMP - V 0.7-5
================

Overview
**********

AOMP is a scripted build of LLVM and supporting software. It has support for OpenMP target offload on AMD GPUs. Since AOMP is a clang/llvm compiler, it also supports GPU offloading with HIP, CUDA, and OpenCL.

Some sources to support OpenMP target offload on AMD GPUs have not yet been merged into the upstream LLVM trunk. However all sources used by AOMP are available in `AOMP repositories <https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/aomp/blob/master/bin/README.md#repositories>`_. One of those repositories is a `mirror of the LLVM monorepo llvm-project <https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/aomp/blob/master/bin/README.md#repositories>`_ with a set of commits applied to a stable LLVM release branch.

The bin directory of this repository contains a README.md and build scripts needed to download, build, and install AOMP from source. In addition to the mirrored `LLVM project repository <https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/llvm-project>`_, AOMP uses a number of open-source ROCm components. The build scripts will download, build, and install all components needed for AOMP. However, we recommend that you install the latest release of the `debian or rpm package <https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/aomp/releases>`_ for AOMP described in the install section.

AOMP Install
**************

Platform Install Options:

    * Ubuntu or Debian
    * SUSE SLES-15-SP1
    * RHEL 7
    * Install Without Root
    * Build and Install from release source tarball
    * Development Source Build and Install


AOMP Debian/Ubuntu Install
----------------------------

AOMP will install to /usr/lib/aomp. The AOMP environment variable will automatically be set to the install location. This may require a new terminal to be launched to see the change.

On Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic beaver), run these commands:

::
  
  wget https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/aomp/releases/download/rel_0.7-5/aomp_Ubuntu1804_0.7-5_amd64.deb
  sudo dpkg -i aomp_Ubuntu1804_0.7-5_amd64.deb


On Ubuntu 16.04, run these commands:

::

  wget https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/aomp/releases/download/rel_0.7-5/aomp_Ubuntu1604_0.7-5_amd64.deb
  sudo dpkg -i aomp_Ubuntu1604_0.7-5_amd64.deb

The AOMP bin directory (which includes the standard clang and llvm binaries) is not intended to be in your PATH for typical operation.

Prerequisites
----------------

**AMD KFD Driver**

These commands are for supported Debian-based systems and target only the rock_dkms core component. More information can be found `HERE <https://rocm.github.io/ROCmInstall.html#ubuntu-support---installing-from-a-debian-repository>`_.

::

  echo 'SUBSYSTEM=="kfd", KERNEL=="kfd", TAG+="uaccess", GROUP="video"' | sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/70-kfd.rules
  wget -qO - http://repo.radeon.com/rocm/apt/debian/rocm.gpg.key | sudo apt-key add -
  echo 'deb [arch=amd64] http://repo.radeon.com/rocm/apt/debian/ xenial main' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/rocm.list
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install rock-dkms

  sudo reboot
  sudo usermod -a -G video $USER



**NVIDIA CUDA Driver**

If you build AOMP with support for nvptx GPUs, you must first install CUDA 10. Note these instructions reference the install for Ubuntu 16.04.

**Download Instructions for CUDA (Ubuntu 16.04)**

    Go to https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-10.0-download-archive
    For Ubuntu 16.04, select Linux®, x86_64, Ubuntu, 16.04, deb(local) and then click Download. Note you can change these options for your specific distribution type.
    Navigate to the debian in your Linux® directory and run the following commands:

::

   sudo dpkg -i cuda-repo-ubuntu1604-10-0-local-10.0.130-410.48_1.0-1_amd64.deb
   sudo apt-key add /var/cuda-repo-10-0-local-10.0.130-410.48/7fa2af80.pub
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install cuda


Depending on your system the CUDA install could take a very long time.

AOMP SUSE SLES-15-SP1 Install
-------------------------------

AOMP will install to /usr/lib/aomp. The AOMP environment variable will automatically be set to the install location. This may require a new terminal to be launched to see the change.

::

  wget https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/aomp/releases/download/rel_0.7-5/aomp_SLES15_SP1-0.7-5.x86_64.rpm
  sudo rpm -i aomp_SLES15_SP1-0.7-5.x86_64.rpm


Confirm AOMP environment variable is set:

::

  echo $AOMP


**Prerequisites**

The ROCm kernel driver is required for AMD GPU support. Also, to control access to the ROCm device, a user group "video" must be created and users need to be added to this group.

**AMD KFD DRIVER**

**Important Note:** There is a conflict with the KFD when simultaneously running the GUI on SLES-15-SP1, which leads to unpredicatable behavior when offloading to the GPU. We recommend using SLES-15-SP1 in text mode to avoid running both the KFD and GUI at the same time.

SUSE SLES-15-SP1 comes with kfd support installed. To verify this:

::

  sudo dmesg | grep kfd
  sudo dmesg | grep amdgpu


**Set Group Access**

::

  echo 'SUBSYSTEM=="kfd", KERNEL=="kfd", TAG+="uaccess", GROUP="video"' | sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/70-kfd.rules
  sudo reboot
  sudo usermod -a -G video $USER

**NVIDIA CUDA Driver**

If you build AOMP with support for nvptx GPUs, you must first install CUDA 10.

Download Instructions for CUDA (SLES15)

    Go to https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-10.0-download-archive
    For SLES-15, select Linux®, x86_64, SLES, 15.0, rpm(local) and then click Download.
    Navigate to the rpm in your Linux® directory and run the following commands:

::

  sudo rpm -i cuda-repo-sles15-10-0-local-10.0.130-410.48-1.0-1.x86_64.rpm
  sudo zypper refresh
  sudo zypper install cuda


If prompted, select the 'always trust key' option. Depending on your system the CUDA install could take a very long time.

**Important Note:** If using a GUI on SLES-15-SP1, such as gnome, the installation of CUDA may cause the GUI to fail to load. This seems to be caused by a symbolic link pointing to nvidia-libglx.so instead of xorg-libglx.so. This can be fixed by updating the symbolic link:

::

  sudo rm /etc/alternatives/libglx.so
  sudo ln -s /usr/lib64/xorg/modules/extensions/xorg/xorg-libglx.so /etc/alternatives/libglx.so


AOMP RHEL 7 Install
---------------------

AOMP will install to /usr/lib/aomp. The AOMP environment variable will automatically be set to the install location. This may require a new terminal to be launched to see the change.

**The installation may need the following dependency:**

::

  sudo yum install perl-Digest-MD5


**Download and Install**

::

  wget https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/aomp/releases/download/rel_0.7-5/aomp_REDHAT_7-0.7-5.x86_64.rpm
  sudo rpm -i aomp_REDHAT_7-0.7-5.x86_64.rpm

If CUDA is not installed the installation may cancel, to bypass this:

::

  sudo rpm -i --nodeps aomp_REDHAT_7-0.7-5.x86_64.rpm

Confirm AOMP environment variable is set:

::

  echo $AOMP


**Prerequisites**

The ROCm kernel driver is required for AMD GPU support. Also, to control access to the ROCm device, a user group "video" must be created and users need to be added to this group.

**AMD KFD Driver**

::

  sudo subscription-manager repos --enable rhel-server-rhscl-7-rpms
  sudo subscription-manager repos --enable rhel-7-server-optional-rpms
  sudo subscription-manager repos --enable rhel-7-server-extras-rpms
  sudo rpm -ivh https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm


**Install and setup Devtoolset-7**

Devtoolset-7 is recommended, follow instructions 1-3 here:
Note that devtoolset-7 is a Software Collections package, and it is not supported by AMD. https://www.softwarecollections.org/en/scls/rhscl/devtoolset-7/

**Install dkms tool**

::

  sudo yum install -y epel-release
  sudo yum install -y dkms kernel-headers-`uname -r` kernel-devel-`uname -r`

Create a /etc/yum.repos.d/rocm.repo file with the following contents:

::

  [ROCm]
  name=ROCm
  baseurl=http://repo.radeon.com/rocm/yum/rpm
  enabled=1
  gpgcheck=0

**Install rock-dkms**

::

  sudo yum install rock-dkms


**Set Group Access**

::

  echo 'SUBSYSTEM=="kfd", KERNEL=="kfd", TAG+="uaccess", GROUP="video"' | sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/70-kfd.rules
  sudo reboot
  sudo usermod -a -G video $USER

**NVIDIA CUDA Driver**

To build AOMP with support for nvptx GPUs, you must first install CUDA 10. We recommend CUDA 10.0. CUDA 10.1 will not work until AOMP moves to the trunk development of LLVM 9. The CUDA installation is now optional.

**Download Instructions for CUDA (CentOS/RHEL 7)**

    * Go to https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-10.0-download-archive
    * For SLES-15, select Linux®, x86_64, RHEL or CentOS, 7, rpm(local) and then click Download.
    * Navigate to the rpm in your Linux® directory and run the following commands:

::

  sudo rpm -i cuda-repo-rhel7-10-0-local-10.0.130-410.48-1.0-1.x86_64.rpm
  sudo yum clean all
  sudo yum install cuda

Install Without Root
----------------------

By default, the packages install their content to the release directory /usr/lib/aomp_0.X-Y and then a symbolic link is created at /usr/lib/aomp to the release directory. This requires root access.

Once installed go to `TESTINSTALL <https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/aomp/blob/master/docs/TESTINSTALL.md>`_ for instructions on getting started with AOMP examples.

**Debian**

To install the debian package without root access into your home directory, you can run these commands.
On Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic beaver):

::

   wget https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/aomp/releases/download/rel_0.7-5/aomp_Ubuntu1804_0.7-5_amd64.deb
   dpkg -x aomp_Ubuntu1804_0.7-5_amd64.deb /tmp/temproot


On Ubuntu 16.04:

::

   wget https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/aomp/releases/download/rel_0.7-5/aomp_Ubuntu1604_0.7-5_amd64.deb
   dpkg -x aomp_Ubuntu1604_0.7-5_amd64.deb /tmp/temproot

::

   mv /tmp/temproot/usr $HOME
   export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/usr/lib/aomp/bin
   export AOMP=$HOME/usr/lib/aomp

The last two commands could be put into your .bash_profile file so you can always access the compiler.

**RPM**

To install the rpm package without root access into your home directory, you can run these commands.

::

   mkdir /tmp/temproot ; cd /tmp/temproot 
   wget https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/aomp/releases/download/rel_0.7-5/aomp_SLES15_SP1-0.7-5.x86_64.rpm
   rpm2cpio aomp_SLES15_SP1-0.7-5.x86_64.rpm | cpio -idmv
   mv /tmp/temproot/usr/lib $HOME
   export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/rocm/aomp/bin
   export AOMP=$HOME/rocm/aomp

The last two commands could be put into your .bash_profile file so you can always access the compiler.

Build and Install From Release Source Tarball
------------------------------------------------

The AOMP build and install from the release source tarball can be done manually or with spack. Building from source requires a number of platform dependencies. These dependencies are not yet provided with the spack configuration file. So if you are building from source either manually or building with spack, you must install the prerequisites for the platforms listed below.

**Source Build Prerequisites**

To build AOMP from source you must: 1. install certain distribution packages, 2. ensure the KFD kernel module is installed and operating, 3. create the Unix video group, and 4. install spack if required.

**1. Required Distribution Packages**

**Debian or Ubuntu Packages**

::

   sudo apt-get install cmake g++-5 g++ pkg-config libpci-dev libnuma-dev libelf-dev libffi-dev git python libopenmpi-dev gawk


**SLES-15-SP1 Packages**

::

  sudo zypper install -y git pciutils-devel cmake python-base libffi-devel gcc gcc-c++ libnuma-devel libelf-devel patchutils openmpi2-devel


**RHEL 7 Packages**

Building from source requires a newer gcc. Devtoolset-7 is recommended, follow instructions 1-3 here:
Note that devtoolset-7 is a Software Collections package, and it is not supported by AMD. https://www.softwarecollections.org/en/scls/rhscl/devtoolset-7/

**The build_aomp.sh script will automatically enable devtoolset-7 if found in /opt/rh/devtoolset-7/enable. If you want to build an individual component you will need to manually start devtoolset-7 from the instructions above.**

::

  sudo yum install cmake3 pciutils-devel numactl-devel libffi-devel


The build scripts use cmake, so we need to link cmake --> cmake3 in /usr/bin

::

  sudo ln -s /usr/bin/cmake3 /usr/bin/cmake'


**2. Verify KFD Driver**

Please verify you have the proper software installed as AOMP needs certain support to function properly, such as the KFD driver for AMD GPUs.

**Debian or Ubuntu Support**

These commands are for supported Debian-based systems and target only the rock_dkms core component. More information can be found `HERE <https://rocm.github.io/ROCmInstall.html#ubuntu-support---installing-from-a-debian-repository>`_.

::

  wget -qO - http://repo.radeon.com/rocm/apt/debian/rocm.gpg.key | sudo apt-key add -
  echo 'deb [arch=amd64] http://repo.radeon.com/rocm/apt/debian/ xenial main' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/rocm.list
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install rock-dkms


**SUSE SLES-15-SP1 Support**

**Important Note:** There is a conflict with the KFD when simultaneously running the GUI on SLES-15-SP1, which leads to unpredicatable behavior when offloading to the GPU. We recommend using SLES-15-SP1 in text mode to avoid running both the KFD and GUI at the same time.

SUSE SLES-15-SP1 comes with kfd support installed. To verify this:

::

  sudo dmesg | grep kfd
  sudo dmesg | grep amdgpu


**RHEL 7 Support**

::

  sudo subscription-manager repos --enable rhel-server-rhscl-7-rpms
  sudo subscription-manager repos --enable rhel-7-server-optional-rpms
  sudo subscription-manager repos --enable rhel-7-server-extras-rpms
  sudo rpm -ivh https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm


**Install dkms tool**

::

  sudo yum install -y epel-release
  sudo yum install -y dkms kernel-headers-`uname -r` kernel-devel-`uname -r`


Create a /etc/yum.repos.d/rocm.repo file with the following contents:

::

  [ROCm]
  name=ROCm
  baseurl=http://repo.radeon.com/rocm/yum/rpm
  enabled=1
  gpgcheck=0


**Install rock-dkms**

::

  sudo yum install rock-dkms

3. Create the Unix Video Group

Regardless of Linux distribution, you must create a video group to contain the users authorized to use the GPU.

::

  echo 'SUBSYSTEM=="kfd", KERNEL=="kfd", TAG+="uaccess", GROUP="video"' | sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/70-kfd.rules
  sudo reboot
  sudo usermod -a -G video $USER

4. Install spack

To use spack to build and install from the release source tarball, you must install spack first. Please refer to these `install instructions for instructions <https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html#installation>`_ on installing spack. Remember,the aomp spack configuration file is currently missing dependencies, so be sure to install the packages listed above before proceeding.

**Build AOMP manually from release source tarball**

To build and install aomp from the release source tarball run these commands:

::

   wget https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/aomp/releases/download/rel_0.7-5/aomp-0.7-5.tar.gz
   tar -xzf aomp-0.7-5.tar.gz
   cd aomp
   nohup make &

Depending on your system, the last command could take a very long time. So it is recommended to use nohup and background the process. The simple Makefile that make will use runs build script "build_aomp.sh" and sets some flags to avoid git checks and applying ROCm patches. Here is that Makefile:

::

  AOMP ?= /usr/local/aomp
  AOMP_REPOS = $(shell pwd)
  all:
        AOMP=$(AOMP) AOMP_REPOS=$(AOMP_REPOS) AOMP_CHECK_GIT_BRANCH=0 AOMP_APPLY_ROCM_PATCHES=0 $(AOMP_REPOS)/aomp/bin/build_aomp.sh


If you set the environment variable AOMP, the Makefile will install to that directory. Otherwise, the Makefile will install into /usr/local. So you must have authorization to write into /usr/local if you do not set the environment variable AOMP. Let's assume you set the environment variable AOMP to "$HOME/rocm/aomp" in .bash_profile. The build_aomp.sh script will install into $HOME/rocm/aomp_0.7-5 and create a symbolic link from $HOME/rocm/aomp to $HOME/rocm/aomp_0.7-5. This feature allows multiple versions of AOMP to be installed concurrently. To enable a backlevel version of AOMP, simply set AOMP to $HOME/rocm/aomp_0.7-4.

**Build AOMP with spack**

Assuming your have installed the prerequisites listed above, use these commands to fetch the source and build aomp. Currently the aomp configuration is not yet in the spack git hub so you must create the spack package first.

::

   wget https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/aomp/blob/master/bin/package.py
   spack create -n aomp -t makefile --force https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/aomp/releases/download/rel_0.7-5/aomp-0.7-5.tar.gz
   spack edit aomp
   spack install aomp


The "spack create" command will download and start an editor of a newly created spack config file. With the exception of the sha256 value, copy the contents of the downloaded package.py file into into the spack configuration file. You may restart this editor with the command "spack edit aomp"

Depending on your system, the "spack install aomp" command could take a very long time. Unless you set the AOMP environment variable, AOMP will be installed in /usr/local/aomp_ with a symbolic link from /usr/local/aomp to /usr/local/aomp_. Be sure you have write access to /usr/local or set AOMP to a location where you have write access.


Source Install V 0.7-6 (DEV)
--------------------------------

Build and install from sources is possible. However, the source build for AOMP is complex for several reasons.

    * Many repos are required. The clone_aomp.sh script ensures you have all repos and the correct branch.
    * Requires that Cuda SDK 10 is installed for NVIDIA GPUs. ROCm does not need to be installed for AOMP.
    * It is a bootstrapped build. The built and installed LLVM compiler is used to build library components.
    * Additional package dependencies are required that are not required when installing the AOMP package.

**Source Build Prerequisites**

**1. Required Distribution Packages**

**Debian or Ubuntu Packages**

::

   sudo apt-get install cmake g++-5 g++ pkg-config libpci-dev libnuma-dev libelf-dev libffi-dev git python libopenmpi-dev gawk

**SLES-15-SP1 Packages**

::

  sudo zypper install -y git pciutils-devel cmake python-base libffi-devel gcc gcc-c++ libnuma-devel libelf-devel patchutils openmpi2-devel


**RHEL 7 Packages**

Building from source requires a newer gcc. Devtoolset-7 is recommended, follow instructions 1-3 here:
Note that devtoolset-7 is a Software Collections package, and it is not supported by AMD. https://www.softwarecollections.org/en/scls/rhscl/devtoolset-7/

**The build_aomp.sh script will automatically enable devtoolset-7 if found in /opt/rh/devtoolset-7/enable. If you want to build an individual component you will need to manually start devtoolset-7 from the instructions above.**

::

  sudo yum install cmake3 pciutils-devel numactl-devel libffi-devel


The build scripts use cmake, so we need to link cmake --> cmake3 in /usr/bin

::

  sudo ln -s /usr/bin/cmake3 /usr/bin/cmake


**2. Verify KFD Driver**

Please verify you have the proper software installed as AOMP needs certain support to function properly, such as the KFD driver for AMD GPUs.

**Debian or Ubuntu Support**

These commands are for supported Debian-based systems and target only the rock_dkms core component. More information can be found `HERE <https://rocm.github.io/ROCmInstall.html#ubuntu-support---installing-from-a-debian-repository>`_.

::

  wget -qO - http://repo.radeon.com/rocm/apt/debian/rocm.gpg.key | sudo apt-key add -
  echo 'deb [arch=amd64] http://repo.radeon.com/rocm/apt/debian/ xenial main' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/rocm.list
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install rock-dkms


**SUSE SLES-15-SP1 Support**

**Important Note:** There is a conflict with the KFD when simultaneously running the GUI on SLES-15-SP1, which leads to unpredicatable behavior when offloading to the GPU. We recommend using SLES-15-SP1 in text mode to avoid running both the KFD and GUI at the same time.

SUSE SLES-15-SP1 comes with kfd support installed. To verify this:

::

  sudo dmesg | grep kfd
  sudo dmesg | grep amdgpu

**RHEL 7 Support**

::

  sudo subscription-manager repos --enable rhel-server-rhscl-7-rpms
  sudo subscription-manager repos --enable rhel-7-server-optional-rpms
  sudo subscription-manager repos --enable rhel-7-server-extras-rpms
  sudo rpm -ivh https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm

**Install dkms tool**

::

  sudo yum install -y epel-release
  sudo yum install -y dkms kernel-headers-`uname -r` kernel-devel-`uname -r`

Create a /etc/yum.repos.d/rocm.repo file with the following contents:

::

  [ROCm]
  name=ROCm
  baseurl=http://repo.radeon.com/rocm/yum/rpm
  enabled=1
  gpgcheck=0

**Install rock-dkms**

::

  sudo yum install rock-dkms

**3. Create the Unix Video Group**

::

  echo 'SUBSYSTEM=="kfd", KERNEL=="kfd", TAG+="uaccess", GROUP="video"' | sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/70-kfd.rules
  sudo reboot
  sudo usermod -a -G video $USER

**Clone and Build AOMP**

::

   cd $HOME ; mkdir -p git/aomp ; cd git/aomp
   git clone https://github.com/rocm-developer-tools/aomp
   cd $HOME/git/aomp/aomp/bin

**Choose a Build Version (Development or Release)** The development version is the next version to be released. It is possible that the development version is broken due to regressions that often occur during development. If instead, you want to build from the sources of a previous release such as 0.7-5 that is possible as well.

**For the Development Branch:**

   git checkout master
   git pull

For the Release Branch:

   git checkout rel_0.7-5
   git pull

Clone and Build:

   ./clone_aomp.sh
   ./build_aomp.sh

Depending on your system, the last two commands could take a very long time. For more information, please refer :ref:`AOMP developers README`.

You only need to do the checkout/pull in the AOMP repository. The file "bin/aomp_common_vars" lists the branches of each repository for a particular AOMP release. In the master branch of AOMP, aomp_common_vars lists the development branches. It is a good idea to run clone_aomp.sh twice after you checkout a release to be sure you pulled all the checkouts for a particular release.

AOMP Limitations
*****************

See the `release notes <https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/aomp/releases>`_ in github. Here are some limitations.

 - Dwarf debugging is turned off for GPUs. -g will turn on host level debugging only.
 - Some simd constructs fail to vectorize on both host and GPUs.  

ROCmValidationSuite
=====================

The ROCm Validation Suite (RVS) is a system administrator’s and cluster manager's tool for detecting and troubleshooting common problems affecting AMD GPU(s) running in a high-performance computing environment, enabled using the ROCm software stack on a compatible platform.

The RVS is a collection of tests, benchmarks and qualification tools each targeting a specific sub-system of the ROCm platform. All of the tools are implemented in software and share a common command line interface. Each set of tests are implemented in a “module” which is a library encapsulating the functionality specific to the tool. The CLI can specify the directory containing modules to use when searching for libraries to load. Each module may have a set of options that it defines and a configuration file that supports its execution.

ROCmValidationSuite Modules
******************************

**GPU Properties – GPUP**

The GPU Properties module queries the configuration of a target device and returns the device’s static characteristics. These static values can be used to debug issues such as device support, performance and firmware problems.

**GPU Monitor – GM module**

The GPU monitor tool is capable of running on one, some or all of the GPU(s) installed and will report various information at regular intervals. The module can be configured to halt another RVS modules execution if one of the quantities exceeds a specified boundary value.

**PCI Express State Monitor – PESM module?**

The PCIe State Monitor tool is used to actively monitor the PCIe interconnect between the host platform and the GPU. The module will register a “listener” on a target GPU’s PCIe interconnect, and log a message whenever it detects a state change. The PESM will be able to detect the following state changes:

    * PCIe link speed changes
    * GPU power state changes

**ROCm Configuration Qualification Tool - RCQT module**

The ROCm Configuration Qualification Tool ensures the platform is capable of running ROCm applications and is configured correctly. It checks the installed versions of the ROCm components and the platform configuration of the system. This includes checking that dependencies, corresponding to the associated operating system and runtime environment, are installed correctly. Other qualification steps include checking:

    * The existence of the /dev/kfd device
    * The /dev/kfd device’s permissions
    * The existence of all required users and groups that support ROCm
    * That the user mode components are compatible with the drivers, both the KFD and the amdgpu driver.
    * The configuration of the runtime linker/loader qualifying that all ROCm libraries are in the correct search path.

**PCI Express Qualification Tool – PEQT module**

The PCIe Qualification Tool consists is used to qualify the PCIe bus on which the GPU is connected. The qualification test will be capable of determining the following characteristics of the PCIe bus interconnect to a GPU:

    * Support for Gen 3 atomic completers
    * DMA transfer statistics
    * PCIe link speed
    * PCIe link width

**SBIOS Mapping Qualification Tool – SMQT module**

The GPU SBIOS mapping qualification tool is designed to verify that a platform’s SBIOS has satisfied the BAR mapping requirements for VDI and Radeon Instinct products for ROCm support.

Refer to the “ROCm Use of Advanced PCIe Features and Overview of How BAR Memory is Used In ROCm Enabled System” web page for more information about how BAR memory is initialized by VDI and Radeon products.

**P2P Benchmark and Qualification Tool – PBQT module**

The P2P Benchmark and Qualification Tool is designed to provide the list of all GPUs that support P2P and characterize the P2P links between peers. In addition to testing for P2P compatibility, this test will perform a peer-to-peer throughput test between all P2P pairs for performance evaluation. The P2P Benchmark and Qualification Tool will allow users to pick a collection of two or more GPUs on which to run. The user will also be able to select whether or not they want to run the throughput test on each of the pairs.

Please see the web page “ROCm, a New Era in Open GPU Computing” to find out more about the P2P solutions available in a ROCm environment.

**PCI Express Bandwidth Benchmark – PEBB module**

The PCIe Bandwidth Benchmark attempts to saturate the PCIe bus with DMA transfers between system memory and a target GPU card’s memory. The maximum bandwidth obtained is reported to help debug low bandwidth issues. The benchmark should be capable of targeting one, some or all of the GPUs installed in a platform, reporting individual benchmark statistics for each.

**GPU Stress Test - GST module**

The GPU Stress Test runs a Graphics Stress test or SGEMM/DGEMM (Single/Double-precision General Matrix Multiplication) workload on one, some or all GPUs. The GPUs can be of the same or different types. The duration of the benchmark should be configurable, both in terms of time (how long to run) and iterations (how many times to run).

The test should be capable driving the power level equivalent to the rated TDP of the card, or levels below that. The tool must be capable of driving cards at TDP-50% to TDP-100%, in 10% incremental jumps. This should be controllable by the user.

**Input EDPp Test - IET module**

The Input EDPp Test generates EDP peak power on all input rails. This test is used to verify if the system PSU is capable of handling the worst case power spikes of the board. Peak Current at defined period = 1 minute moving average power.

::

  cd ./build/bin
  sudo ./rvs -d 3
  sudo ./rvsqa.new.sh  ; It will run complete rvs test suite


Regression
***********

Regression is currently implemented for PQT module only. It comes in the form of a Python script run_regression.py.

The script will first create valid configuration files on $RVS_BUILD/regression folder. It is done by invoking prq_create_conf.py script to generate valid configuration files. If you need different tests, modify the prq_create_conf.py script to generate them.

Then, it will iterate through generated files and invoke RVS to specifying also JSON output and -d 3 logging level.

Finally, it will iterate over generated JSON output files and search for ERROR string. Results are written into $RVS_BUILD/regression/regression_res file.

Results are written into $RVS_BUILD/regression/

**Environment variables**

Before running the run_regression.py you first need to set the following environment variables for location of RVS source tree and build folders (ajdust for your particular clone):

::

  export WB=/work/yourworkfolder
  export RVS=$WB/ROCmValidationSuite
  export RVS_BUILD=$RVS/../build

**Running the script**

Just do:

::

  cd $RVS/regression
  ./run_regression.py



ROCr Debug Agent
================

The ROCr Debug Agent is a library that can be loaded by ROCm Platform
Runtime to provide the following functionality:

-  Print the state of wavefronts that report memory violation or upon
   executing a ``s_trap 2`` instruction.
-  Allows SIGINT (``ctrl c``) or SIGTERM (``kill -15``) to print
   wavefront state of aborted GPU dispatches.
-  It is enabled on Vega10 (since ROCm1.9), Vega20 (since ROCm2.0) GPUs.

Usage
*****

To use the ROCr Debug Agent set the following environment variable:

.. code:: sh

   export HSA_TOOLS_LIB=librocr_debug_agent64.so

This will use the ROCr Debug Agent library installed at
/opt/rocm/lib/librocr_debug_agent64.so by default since the ROCm
installation adds /opt/rocm/lib to the system library path. To use a
different version set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH, for example:

.. code:: sh

   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path_to_directory_containing_librocr_debug_agent64.so

To display the machine code instructions of wavefronts, together with
the source text location, the ROCr Debug Agent uses the llvm-objdump
tool. Ensure that a version that supports AMD GCN GPUs is on your
``$PATH``. For example, for ROCm 3.0:

.. code:: sh

   export PATH=/opt/rocm/opencl/bin/x86_64/:$PATH

Execute your application.

If the application encounters a GPU error it will display the wavefront
state of the GPU to ``stdout``. Possible error states include:

-  The GPU executes a memory instruction that causes a memory violation.
   This is reported as an XNACK error state.
-  Queue error.
-  The GPU executes an ``S_TRAP`` instruction. The ``__builtin_trap()``
   language builtin can be used to generate a ``S_TRAP``.
-  A SIGINT (``ctrl c``) or SIGTERM (``kill -15``) signal is sent to the
   application while executing GPU code. Enabled by the
   ``ROCM_DEBUG_ENABLE_LINUX_SIGNALS`` environment variable.

For example, a sample print out for GPU memory fault is:

::

   Memory access fault by GPU agent: AMD gfx900
   Node: 1
   Address: 0x18DB4xxx (page not present;write access to a read-only page;)

   64 wavefront(s) found in XNACK error state @PC: 0x0000001100E01310
   printing the first one:

   Faulty PC offset: 1310

   Aborted (core dumped)

Options
*******

Dump Output
-----------

By default the wavefront dump is sent to ``stdout``.

To save to a file use:

.. code:: sh

   export ROCM_DEBUG_WAVE_STATE_DUMP=file

This will create a file called ``ROCm_Wave_State_Dump`` in code object
directory (see below).

To return to the default ``stdout`` use either of the following:

.. code:: sh

   export ROCM_DEBUG_WAVE_STATE_DUMP=stdout
   unset ROCM_DEBUG_WAVE_STATE_DUMP

Linux Signal Control
--------------------

The following environment variable can be used to enable dumping
wavefront states when SIGINT (``ctrl c``) or SIGTERM (``kill -15``) is
sent to the application:

.. code:: sh

   export ROCM_DEBUG_ENABLE_LINUX_SIGNALS=1

Either of the following will disable this behavior:

.. code:: sh

   export ROCM_DEBUG_ENABLE_LINUX_SIGNALS=0
   unset ROCM_DEBUG_ENABLE_LINUX_SIGNALS

Code Object Saving
------------------

When the ROCr Debug Agent is enabled, each GPU code object loaded by the
ROCm Platform Runtime will be saved in a file in the code object
directory. By default the code object directory is
``/tmp/ROCm_Tmp_PID_XXXX/`` where ``XXXX`` is the application process
ID. The code object directory can be specified using the following
environent variable:

.. code:: sh

   export ROCM_DEBUG_SAVE_CODE_OBJECT=code_object_directory

This will use the path ``/code_object_directory``.

Loaded code objects will be saved in files named ``ROCm_Code_Object_N``
where N is a unique integer starting at 0 of the order in which the code
object was loaded.

If the default code object directory is used, then the saved code object
file will be deleted when it is unloaded with the ROCm Platform Runtime,
and the complete code object directory will be deleted when the
application exits normally. If a code object directory path is specified
then neither the saved code objects, nor the code object directory will
be deleted.

To return to using the default code object directory use:

.. code:: sh

   unset ROCM_DEBUG_SAVE_CODE_OBJECT

Logging
-------

By default ROCr Debug Agent logging is disabled. It can be enabled to
display to ``stdout`` using:

.. code:: sh

   export ROCM_DEBUG_ENABLE_AGENTLOG=stdout

Or to a file using:

.. code:: sh

   export ROCM_DEBUG_ENABLE_AGENTLOG=<filename>

Which will write to the file ``<filename>_AgentLog_PID_XXXX.log``.

HCC: Heterogeneous Compute Compiler
=====================================

**HCC : An open source C++ compiler for heterogeneous devices**

This repository hosts the HCC compiler implementation project. The goal is to implement a compiler that takes a program that conforms to a parallel programming standard such as HC, C++ 17 ParallelSTL and transforms it into the AMD GCN ISA.

Deprecation Notice
*******************

AMD is deprecating HCC to put more focus on HIP development and on other languages supporting heterogeneous compute. We will no longer develop any new feature in HCC and we will stop maintaining HCC after its final release, which is planned for June 2019. If your application was developed with the hc C++ API, we would encourage you to transition it to other languages supported by AMD, such as HIP or OpenCL. HIP and hc language share the same compiler technology, so many hc kernel language features (including inline assembly) are also available through the HIP compilation path.

The project is based on LLVM+CLANG. For more information, please visit :ref:`HCCguide`

GCN Assembler and Disassembler
==============================

The Art of AMDGCN Assembly: How to Bend the Machine to Your Will
*****************************************************************
The ability to write code in assembly is essential to achieving the best performance for a GPU program. In a previous blog we described how to combine several languages in a single program using ROCm and Hsaco. This article explains how to produce Hsaco from assembly code and also takes a closer look at some new features of the GCN architecture. I'd like to thank Ilya Perminov of Luxsoft for co-authoring this blog post. Programs written for GPUs should achieve the highest performance possible. Even carefully written ones, however, won’t always employ 100% of the GPU’s capabilities. Some reasons are the following:

 * The program may be written in a high level language that does not expose all of the features available on the hardware.
 * The compiler is unable to produce optimal ISA code, either because the compiler needs to ‘play it safe’ while adhering to the     	semantics of a language or because the compiler itself is generating un-optimized code.

Consider a program that uses one of GCN’s new features (source code is available on `GitHub <https://github.com/RadeonOpenCompute/LLVM-AMDGPU-Assembler-Extra>`_). Recent hardware architecture updates—DPP and DS Permute instructions—enable efficient data sharing between wavefront lanes. To become more familiar with the instruction set, review the `GCN ISA Reference Guide <https://github.com/olvaffe/gpu-docs/blob/master/amd-open-gpu-docs/AMD_GCN3_Instruction_Set_Architecture.pdf>`_. Note: the assembler is currently experimental; some of syntax we describe may change.

DS Permute Instructions
**************************
Two new instructions, ds_permute_b32 and ds_bpermute_b32, allow VGPR data to move between lanes on the basis of an index from another VGPR. These instructions use LDS hardware to route data between the 64 lanes, but they don’t write to LDS memory. The difference between them is what to index: the source-lane ID or the destination-lane ID. In other words, ds_permute_b32 says “put my lane data in lane i,” and ds_bpermute_b32 says “read data from lane i.” The GCN ISA Reference Guide provides a more formal description. The test kernel is simple: read the initial data and indices from memory into GPRs, do the permutation in the GPRs and write the data back to memory. An analogous OpenCL kernel would have this form:

.. code:: cpp

  __kernel void hello_world(__global const uint * in, __global const uint * index, __global uint * out)
  {
      size_t i = get_global_id(0);
      out[i] = in[ index[i] ];
  }

Passing Parameters to a Kernel
*******************************
Formal HSA arguments are passed to a kernel using a special read-only memory segment called kernarg. Before a wavefront starts, the base address of the kernarg segment is written to an SGPR pair. The memory layout of variables in kernarg must employ the same order as the list of kernel formal arguments, starting at offset 0, with no padding between variables—except to honor the requirements of natural alignment and any align qualifier. The example host program must create the kernarg segment and fill it with the buffer base addresses. The HSA host code might look like the following:

.. code:: cpp

  /*
  * This is the host-side representation of the kernel arguments that the simplePermute kernel expects.
  */
  struct simplePermute_args_t {
	uint32_t * in;
	uint32_t * index;
	uint32_t * out;
  };
  /*
   * Allocate the kernel-argument buffer from the correct region.
  */
  hsa_status_t status;
  simplePermute_args_t * args = NULL;
  status = hsa_memory_allocate(kernarg_region, sizeof(simplePermute_args_t), (void**)(&args));
  assert(HSA_STATUS_SUCCESS == status);
  aql->kernarg_address = args;
  /*
  * Write the args directly to the kernargs buffer;
  * the code assumes that memory is already allocated for the
  * buffers that in_ptr, index_ptr and out_ptr point to
  */
  args->in = in_ptr;
  args->index = index_ptr;
  args->out = out_ptr;

The host program should also allocate memory for the in, index and out buffers. In the GitHub repository, all the run-time-related  stuff is hidden in the Dispatch and Buffer classes, so the sample code looks much cleaner:

.. code:: cpp

  // Create Kernarg segment
  if (!AllocateKernarg(3 * sizeof(void*))) { return false; }

  // Create buffers
  Buffer *in, *index, *out;
  in = AllocateBuffer(size);
  index = AllocateBuffer(size);
  out = AllocateBuffer(size);

  // Fill Kernarg memory
  Kernarg(in); // Add base pointer to “in” buffer
  Kernarg(index); // Append base pointer to “index” buffer
  Kernarg(out); // Append base pointer to “out” buffer

Initial Wavefront and Register State To launch a kernel in real hardware, the run time needs information about the kernel, such as

   * The LDS size
   * The number of GPRs
   * Which registers need initialization before the kernel starts

  All this data resides in the amd_kernel_code_t structure. A full description of the structure is available in the `AMDGPU-ABI <http://rocm-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ROCm_Compiler_SDK/ROCm-Codeobj-format.html?highlight=finalizer>`_       	specification. This is what it looks like in source code:

::

   .hsa_code_object_version 2,0
   .hsa_code_object_isa 8, 0, 3, "AMD", "AMDGPU"

   .text
   .p2align 8
   .amdgpu_hsa_kernel hello_world

   hello_world:

   .amd_kernel_code_t
   enable_sgpr_kernarg_segment_ptr = 1
   is_ptr64 = 1
   compute_pgm_rsrc1_vgprs = 1
   compute_pgm_rsrc1_sgprs = 0
   compute_pgm_rsrc2_user_sgpr = 2
   kernarg_segment_byte_size = 24
   wavefront_sgpr_count = 8
   workitem_vgpr_count = 5

   v_add_u32     v3, vcc, s0, v0
   v_mov_b32     v4, s1
   v_addc_u32    v4, vcc, v4, 0, vcc
   flat_load_dword  v1, v[1:2]
   flat_load_dword  v2, v[3:4]
   s_waitcnt     vmcnt(0) & lgkmcnt(0)
   v_lshlrev_b32  v1, 2, v1
   ds_bpermute_b32  v1, v1, v2
   v_add_u32     v3, vcc, s4, v0
   v_mov_b32     v2, s5
   v_addc_u32    v4, vcc, v2, 0, vcc
   s_waitcnt     lgkmcnt(0)
   flat_store_dword  v[3:4], v1
   s_endpgm

Currently, a programmer must manually set all non-default values to provide the necessary information. Hopefully, this situation will change with new updates that bring automatic register counting and possibly a new syntax to fill that structure. Before the start of every wavefront execution, the GPU sets up the register state on the basis of the enable_sgpr_* and enable_vgpr_* flags. VGPR v0 is always initialized with a work-item ID in the x dimension. Registers v1 and v2 can be initialized with work-item IDs in the y and z dimensions, respectively. Scalar GPRs can be initialized with a work-group ID and work-group count in each dimension, a dispatch ID, and pointers to kernarg, the aql packet, the aql queue, and so on. Again, the AMDGPU-ABI specification contains a full list in in the section on initial register state. For this example, a 64-bit base kernarg address will be stored in the s[0:1] registers (enable_sgpr_kernarg_segment_ptr = 1), and the work-item thread ID will occupy v0 (by default). Below is the scheme showing initial state for our kernel. 


.. image:: initial_state-768x387.png


The GPR Counting
******************
The next amd_kernel_code_t fields are obvious: is_ptr64 = 1 says we are in 64-bit mode, and kernarg_segment_byte_size = 24 describes the kernarg segment size. The GPR counting is less straightforward, however. The workitem_vgpr_count holds the number of vector registers that each work item uses, and wavefront_sgpr_count holds the number of scalar registers that a wavefront uses. The code above employs v0–v4, so workitem_vgpr_count = 5. But wavefront_sgpr_count = 8 even though the code only shows s0–s5, since the special registers VCC, FLAT_SCRATCH and XNACK are physically stored as part of the wavefront’s SGPRs in the highest-numbered SGPRs. In this example, FLAT_SCRATCH and XNACK are disabled, so VCC has only two additional registers. In current GCN3 hardware, VGPRs are allocated in groups of 4 registers and SGPRs in groups of 16. Previous generations (GCN1 and GCN2) have a VGPR granularity of 4 registers and an SGPR granularity of 8 registers. The fields compute_pgm_rsrc1_*gprs contain a device-specific number for each register-block type to allocate for a wavefront. As we said previously, future updates may enable automatic counting, but for now you can use following formulas for all three GCN GPU generations:

::

  compute_pgm_rsrc1_vgprs = (workitem_vgpr_count-1)/4

  compute_pgm_rsrc1_sgprs = (wavefront_sgpr_count-1)/8

Now consider the corresponding assembly:

::

  // initial state:
  //   s[0:1] - kernarg base address
  //   v0 - workitem id

  s_load_dwordx2  s[4:5], s[0:1], 0x10  // load out_ptr into s[4:5] from kernarg
  s_load_dwordx4  s[0:3], s[0:1], 0x00  // load in_ptr into s[0:1] and index_ptr into s[2:3] from kernarg
  v_lshlrev_b32  v0, 2, v0              // v0 *= 4;
  s_waitcnt     lgkmcnt(0)              // wait for memory reads to finish

  // compute address of corresponding element of index buffer
  // i.e. v[1:2] = &index[workitem_id]
  v_add_u32     v1, vcc, s2, v0
  v_mov_b32     v2, s3
  v_addc_u32    v2, vcc, v2, 0, vcc

  // compute address of corresponding element of in buffer
  // i.e. v[3:4] = &in[workitem_id]
  v_add_u32     v3, vcc, s0, v0
  v_mov_b32     v4, s1
  v_addc_u32    v4, vcc, v4, 0, vcc

  flat_load_dword  v1, v[1:2] // load index[workitem_id] into v1
  flat_load_dword  v2, v[3:4] // load in[workitem_id] into v2
  s_waitcnt     vmcnt(0) & lgkmcnt(0) // wait for memory reads to finish

  // v1 *= 4; ds_bpermute_b32 uses byte offset and registers are dwords
  v_lshlrev_b32  v1, 2, v1

  // perform permutation
  // temp[thread_id] = v2
  // v1 = temp[v1]
  // effectively we got v1 = in[index[thread_id]]
  ds_bpermute_b32  v1, v1, v2

  // compute address of corresponding element of out buffer
  // i.e. v[3:4] = &out[workitem_id]
  v_add_u32     v3, vcc, s4, v0
  v_mov_b32     v2, s5
  v_addc_u32    v4, vcc, v2, 0, vcc

  s_waitcnt     lgkmcnt(0) // wait for permutation to finish

  // store final value in out buffer, i.e. out[workitem_id] = v1
  flat_store_dword  v[3:4], v1

Compiling GCN ASM Kernel Into Hsaco
**************************************
The next step is to produce a Hsaco from the ASM source. LLVM has added support for the AMDGCN assembler, so you can use Clang to do all the necessary magic:

.. code:: sh

  clang -x assembler -target amdgcn--amdhsa -mcpu=fiji -c -o test.o asm_source.s

  clang -target amdgcn--amdhsa test.o -o test.co

The first command assembles an object file from the assembly source, and the second one links everything (you could have multiple source files) into a Hsaco. Now, you can load and run kernels from that Hsaco in a program. The `GitHub examples <https://github.com/RadeonOpenCompute/LLVM-AMDGPU-Assembler-Extra>`_ use Cmake to automatically compile ASM sources. In a future post we will cover DPP, another GCN cross-lane feature that allows vector instructions to grab operands from a neighboring lane.



GCN Assembler Tools
====================

Overview
********
This repository contains the following useful items related to AMDGPU ISA assembler:

   * amdphdrs: utility to convert ELF produced by llvm-mc into AMD Code Object (v1)
   * examples/asm-kernel: example of AMDGPU kernel code
   * examples/gfx8/ds_bpermute: transfer data between lanes in a wavefront with ds_bpermute_b32
   * examples/gfx8/dpp_reduce: calculate prefix sum in a wavefront with DPP instructions
   * examples/gfx8/s_memrealtime: use s_memrealtime instruction to create a delay
   * examples/gfx8/s_memrealtime_inline: inline assembly in OpenCL kernel version of s_memrealtime
   * examples/api/assemble: use LLVM API to assemble a kernel
   * examples/api/disassemble: use LLVM API to disassemble a stream of instructions
   * bin/sp3_to_mc.pl: script to convert some AMD sp3 legacy assembler syntax into LLVM MC
   * examples/sp3: examples of sp3 convertable code

At the time of this writing (February 2016), LLVM trunk build and latest ROCR runtime is needed.

LLVM trunk (May or later) now uses lld as linker and produces AMD Code Object (v2).

Building
*********
Top-level CMakeLists.txt is provided to build everything included. The following CMake variables should be set:

   * HSA_DIR (default /opt/hsa/bin): path to ROCR Runtime
   * LLVM_DIR: path to LLVM build directory

To build everything, create build directory and run cmake and make:

.. code:: sh

  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake -DLLVM_DIR=/srv/git/llvm.git/build ..
  make

Examples that require clang will only be built if clang is built as part of llvm.

Use cases
**********
**Assembling to code object with llvm-mc from command line**

The following llvm-mc command line produces ELF object asm.o from assembly source asm.s:

.. code:: sh

  llvm-mc -arch=amdgcn -mcpu=fiji -filetype=obj -o asm.o asm.s

**Assembling to raw instruction stream with llvm-mc from command line**

It is possible to extract contents of .text section after assembling to code object:

.. code:: sh

  llvm-mc -arch=amdgcn -mcpu=fiji -filetype=obj -o asm.o asm.s
  objdump -h asm.o | grep .text | awk '{print "dd if='asm.o' of='asm' bs=1 count=$[0x" $3 "] skip=$[0x" $6 "]"}' | bash

**Disassembling code object from command line**

The following command line may be used to dump contents of code object:

.. code:: sh

  llvm-objdump -disassemble -mcpu=fiji asm.o

This includes text disassembly of .text section.

**Disassembling raw instruction stream from command line**

The following command line may be used to disassemble raw instruction stream (without ELF structure):

.. code:: sh

  hexdump -v -e '/1 "0x%02X "' asm | llvm-mc -arch=amdgcn -mcpu=fiji -disassemble

Here, hexdump is used to display contents of file in hexadecimal (0x.. form) which is then consumed by llvm-mc.

Assembling source into code object using LLVM API
**************************************************
Refer to examples/api/assemble.

Disassembling instruction stream using LLVM API
**************************************************
Refer to examples/api/disassemble.

**Using amdphdrs**

Note that normally standard lld and Code Object version 2 should be used which is closer to standard ELF format.

amdphdrs (now obsolete) is complimentary utility that can be used to produce AMDGPU Code Object version 1.
For example, given assembly source in asm.s, the following will assemble it and link using amdphdrs:

.. code:: sh

  llvm-mc -arch=amdgcn -mcpu=fiji -filetype=obj -o asm.o asm.s
  andphdrs asm.o asm.co

Differences between LLVM AMDGPU Assembler and AMD SP3 assembler
****************************************************************
**Macro support**

SP3 supports proprietary set of macros/tools. sp3_to_mc.pl script attempts to translate them into GAS syntax understood by llvm-mc.
flat_atomic_cmpswap instruction has 32-bit destination

LLVM AMDGPU:

::

  flat_atomic_cmpswap v7, v[9:10], v[7:8]

SP3:

::

  flat_atomic_cmpswap v[7:8], v[9:10], v[7:8]

Atomic instructions that return value should have glc flag explicitly

LLVM AMDGPU:

::

  flat_atomic_swap_x2 v[0:1], v[0:1], v[2:3] glc

SP3:

::

  flat_atomic_swap_x2 v[0:1], v[0:1], v[2:3]
