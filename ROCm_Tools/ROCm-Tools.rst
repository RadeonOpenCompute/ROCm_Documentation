HCC  
====

**HCC is an Open Source, Optimizing C++ Compiler for Heterogeneous Compute**

This repository hosts the HCC compiler implementation project. The goal is to implement a compiler that takes a program that conforms to a parallel programming standard such as C++ AMP, HC, C++ 17 ParallelSTL, or OpenMP, and transforms it into the AMD GCN ISA.

The project is based on LLVM+CLANG. For more information, please visit the :ref:`HCCwiki`

Download HCC
###############

The project now employs git submodules to manage external components it depends upon. It it advised to add --recursive when you clone the project so all submodules are fetched automatically.

For example: ::

  # automatically fetches all submodules
  git clone --recursive -b clang_tot_upgrade https://github.com/RadeonOpenCompute/hcc.git

For more information about git submodules, please refer to `git documentation <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules>`_.


Build HCC from source
#######################

To configure and build HCC from source, use the following steps:
::
  mkdir -p build; cd build
  cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
  make

To install it, use the following steps:
::
  sudo make install

Use HCC
########

For C++AMP source codes:
::
  hcc `clamp-config --cxxflags --ldflags` foo.cpp

For HC source codes:
::
  hcc `hcc-config --cxxflags --ldflags` foo.cpp

In case you build HCC from source and want to use the compiled binaries directly in the build directory:

For C++AMP source codes:
::
  # notice the --build flag
  bin/hcc `bin/clamp-config --build --cxxflags --ldflags` foo.cpp

For HC source codes:
::
  # notice the --build flag
  bin/hcc `bin/hcc-config --build --cxxflags --ldflags` foo.cpp


Multiple ISA
###############
HCC now supports having multiple GCN ISAs in one executable file. You can do it in different ways:
**use :: ``--amdgpu-target=`` command line option**

It's possible to specify multiple ``--amdgpu-target=``option.

Example: ::

 # ISA for Hawaii(gfx701), Carrizo(gfx801), Tonga(gfx802) and Fiji(gfx803) would 
 # be produced
  hcc `hcc-config --cxxflags --ldflags` \
    --amdgpu-target=gfx701 \
    --amdgpu-target=gfx801 \
    --amdgpu-target=gfx802 \
    --amdgpu-target=gfx803 \
    foo.cpp

**use ``HCC_AMDGPU_TARGET`` env var**

use ``,`` to delimit each AMDGPU target in HCC. Example: 
::
  
  export HCC_AMDGPU_TARGET=gfx701,gfx801,gfx802,gfx803
  # ISA for Hawaii(gfx701), Carrizo(gfx801), Tonga(gfx802) and Fiji(gfx803) would 
  # be produced
  hcc `hcc-config --cxxflags --ldflags` foo.cpp

**configure HCC use CMake ``HSA_AMDGPU_GPU_TARGET`` variable**

If you build HCC from source, it's possible to configure it to automatically produce multiple ISAs via `HSA_AMDGPU_GPU_TARGET` CMake variable.

Use ``;`` to delimit each AMDGPU target. 
Example: ::

 # ISA for Hawaii(gfx701), Carrizo(gfx801), Tonga(gfx802) and Fiji(gfx803) would 
 # be produced by default
 cmake \
    -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
    -DROCM_DEVICE_LIB_DIR=~hcc/ROCm-Device-Libs/build/dist/lib \
    -DHSA_AMDGPU_GPU_TARGET="gfx701;gfx801;gfx802;gfx803" \
    ../hcc

CodeXL Activity Logger
#########################

To enable the `CodeXL Activity Logger <https://github.com/RadeonOpenCompute/ROCm-Profiler/tree/master/CXLActivityLogger>`_, use the  ``USE_CODEXL_ACTIVITY_LOGGER`` environment variable.

Configure the build in the following way: ::

  cmake \
    -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
    -DHSA_AMDGPU_GPU_TARGET=<AMD GPU ISA version string> \
    -DROCM_DEVICE_LIB_DIR=<location of the ROCm-Device-Libs bitcode> \
    -DUSE_CODEXL_ACTIVITY_LOGGER=1 \
    <ToT HCC checkout directory>

In your application compiled using hcc, include the CodeXL Activiy Logger header: 
::
  #include <CXLActivityLogger.h>

For information about the usage of the Activity Logger for profiling, please refer to its `documentation <https://github.com/RadeonOpenCompute/ROCm-Profiler/blob/master/CXLActivityLogger/doc/AMDTActivityLogger.pdf>`_.

HCC with ThinLTO Linking
#########################

To enable the ThinLTO link time, use the ``KMTHINLTO`` environment variable.

Set up your environment in the following way:
::
  export KMTHINLTO=1

**ThinLTO Phase 1 - Implemented**

For applications compiled using hcc, ThinLTO could significantly improve link-time performance. This implementation will maintain kernels in their .bc file format, create module-summaries for each, perform llvm-lto's cross-module function importing and then perform clamp-device (which uses opt and llc tools) on each of the kernel files. These files are linked with lld into one .hsaco per target specified.

**ThinLTO Phase 2 - Under development**
This ThinLTO implementation which will use llvm-lto LLVM tool to replace clamp-device bash script. It adds an optllc option into ThinLTOGenerator, which will perform in-program opt and codegen in parallel.



GCN Assembler and Disassembler
==============================

The Art of AMDGCN Assembly: How to Bend the Machine to Your Will
******************************************************************
The ability to write code in assembly is essential to achieving the best performance for a GPU program. In a previous blog we described how to combine several languages in a single program using ROCm and Hsaco. This article explains how to produce Hsaco from assembly code and also takes a closer look at some new features of the GCN architecture. I'd like to thank Ilya Perminov of Luxsoft for co-authoring this blog post. Programs written for GPUs should achieve the highest performance possible. Even carefully written ones, however, won’t always employ 100% of the GPU’s capabilities. Some reasons are the following:

 * The program may be written in a high level language that does not expose all of the features available on the hardware.
 * The compiler is unable to produce optimal ISA code, either because the compiler needs to ‘play it safe’ while adhering to the     	semantics of a language or because the compiler itself is generating un-optimized code.

Consider a program that uses one of GCN’s new features (source code is available on `GitHub <https://github.com/RadeonOpenCompute/LLVM-AMDGPU-Assembler-Extra>`_). Recent hardware architecture updates—DPP and DS Permute instructions—enable efficient data sharing between wavefront lanes. To become more familiar with the instruction set, review the `GCN ISA Reference Guide <https://github.com/olvaffe/gpu-docs/blob/master/amd-open-gpu-docs/AMD_GCN3_Instruction_Set_Architecture.pdf>`_. Note: the assembler is currently experimental; some of syntax we describe may change.

DS Permute Instructions
**************************
Two new instructions, ds_permute_b32 and ds_bpermute_b32, allow VGPR data to move between lanes on the basis of an index from another VGPR. These instructions use LDS hardware to route data between the 64 lanes, but they don’t write to LDS memory. The difference between them is what to index: the source-lane ID or the destination-lane ID. In other words, ds_permute_b32 says “put my lane data in lane i,” and ds_bpermute_b32 says “read data from lane i.” The GCN ISA Reference Guide provides a more formal description. The test kernel is simple: read the initial data and indices from memory into GPRs, do the permutation in the GPRs and write the data back to memory. An analogous OpenCL kernel would have this form:

::

  __kernel void hello_world(__global const uint * in, __global const uint * index, __global uint * out)
  {
      size_t i = get_global_id(0);
      out[i] = in[ index[i] ];
  }

Passing Parameters to a Kernel
*******************************
Formal HSA arguments are passed to a kernel using a special read-only memory segment called kernarg. Before a wavefront starts, the base address of the kernarg segment is written to an SGPR pair. The memory layout of variables in kernarg must employ the same order as the list of kernel formal arguments, starting at offset 0, with no padding between variables—except to honor the requirements of natural alignment and any align qualifier. The example host program must create the kernarg segment and fill it with the buffer base addresses. The HSA host code might look like the following:

::

  /*
  * This is the host-side representation of the kernel arguments that the simplePermute kernel expects.
  */
  struct simplePermute_args_t {
	uint32_t * in;
	uint32_t * index;
	uint32_t * out;
  };
  /*
   * Allocate the kernel-argument buffer from the correct region.
  */
  hsa_status_t status;
  simplePermute_args_t * args = NULL;
  status = hsa_memory_allocate(kernarg_region, sizeof(simplePermute_args_t), (void**)(&args));
  assert(HSA_STATUS_SUCCESS == status);
  aql->kernarg_address = args;
  /*
  * Write the args directly to the kernargs buffer;
  * the code assumes that memory is already allocated for the 
  * buffers that in_ptr, index_ptr and out_ptr point to
  */
  args->in = in_ptr;
  args->index = index_ptr;
  args->out = out_ptr;

The host program should also allocate memory for the in, index and out buffers. In the GitHub repository, all the run-time-related  stuff is hidden in the Dispatch and Buffer classes, so the sample code looks much cleaner:

::

  // Create Kernarg segment
  if (!AllocateKernarg(3 * sizeof(void*))) { return false; }

  // Create buffers
  Buffer *in, *index, *out;
  in = AllocateBuffer(size);
  index = AllocateBuffer(size);
  out = AllocateBuffer(size);

  // Fill Kernarg memory
  Kernarg(in); // Add base pointer to “in” buffer
  Kernarg(index); // Append base pointer to “index” buffer
  Kernarg(out); // Append base pointer to “out” buffer

Initial Wavefront and Register State To launch a kernel in real hardware, the run time needs information about the kernel, such as

   * The LDS size
   * The number of GPRs
   * Which registers need initialization before the kernel starts

  All this data resides in the amd_kernel_code_t structure. A full description of the structure is available in the `AMDGPU-ABI <http://rocm-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ROCm_Compiler_SDK/ROCm-Codeobj-format.html?highlight=finalizer>`_       	specification. This is what it looks like in source code:

::

   .hsa_code_object_version 2,0
   .hsa_code_object_isa 8, 0, 3, "AMD", "AMDGPU"

   .text
   .p2align 8
   .amdgpu_hsa_kernel hello_world
 
   hello_world:

   .amd_kernel_code_t
   enable_sgpr_kernarg_segment_ptr = 1
   is_ptr64 = 1
   compute_pgm_rsrc1_vgprs = 1
   compute_pgm_rsrc1_sgprs = 0
   compute_pgm_rsrc2_user_sgpr = 2
   kernarg_segment_byte_size = 24
   wavefront_sgpr_count = 8
   workitem_vgpr_count = 5
   .end_amd_kernel_code_t

   s_load_dwordx2  s[4:5], s[0:1], 0x10
   s_load_dwordx4  s[0:3], s[0:1], 0x00
   v_lshlrev_b32  v0, 2, v0
   s_waitcnt     lgkmcnt(0)
   v_add_u32     v1, vcc, s2, v0
   v_mov_b32     v2, s3
   v_addc_u32    v2, vcc, v2, 0, vcc
   v_add_u32     v3, vcc, s0, v0
   v_mov_b32     v4, s1
   v_addc_u32    v4, vcc, v4, 0, vcc
   flat_load_dword  v1, v[1:2]
   flat_load_dword  v2, v[3:4]
   s_waitcnt     vmcnt(0) & lgkmcnt(0)
   v_lshlrev_b32  v1, 2, v1
   ds_bpermute_b32  v1, v1, v2
   v_add_u32     v3, vcc, s4, v0
   v_mov_b32     v2, s5
   v_addc_u32    v4, vcc, v2, 0, vcc
   s_waitcnt     lgkmcnt(0)
   flat_store_dword  v[3:4], v1
   s_endpgm

Currently, a programmer must manually set all non-default values to provide the necessary information. Hopefully, this situation will change with new updates that bring automatic register counting and possibly a new syntax to fill that structure. Before the start of every wavefront execution, the GPU sets up the register state on the basis of the enable_sgpr_* and enable_vgpr_* flags. VGPR v0 is always initialized with a work-item ID in the x dimension. Registers v1 and v2 can be initialized with work-item IDs in the y and z dimensions, respectively. Scalar GPRs can be initialized with a work-group ID and work-group count in each dimension, a dispatch ID, and pointers to kernarg, the aql packet, the aql queue, and so on. Again, the AMDGPU-ABI specification contains a full list in in the section on initial register state. For this example, a 64-bit base kernarg address will be stored in the s[0:1] registers (enable_sgpr_kernarg_segment_ptr = 1), and the work-item thread ID will occupy v0 (by default). Below is the scheme showing initial state for our kernel. initial_state

The GPR Counting
******************
The next amd_kernel_code_t fields are obvious: is_ptr64 = 1 says we are in 64-bit mode, and kernarg_segment_byte_size = 24 describes the kernarg segment size. The GPR counting is less straightforward, however. The workitem_vgpr_count holds the number of vector registers that each work item uses, and wavefront_sgpr_count holds the number of scalar registers that a wavefront uses. The code above employs v0–v4, so workitem_vgpr_count = 5. But wavefront_sgpr_count = 8 even though the code only shows s0–s5, since the special registers VCC, FLAT_SCRATCH and XNACK are physically stored as part of the wavefront’s SGPRs in the highest-numbered SGPRs. In this example, FLAT_SCRATCH and XNACK are disabled, so VCC has only two additional registers. In current GCN3 hardware, VGPRs are allocated in groups of 4 registers and SGPRs in groups of 16. Previous generations (GCN1 and GCN2) have a VGPR granularity of 4 registers and an SGPR granularity of 8 registers. The fields compute_pgm_rsrc1_*gprs contain a device-specific number for each register-block type to allocate for a wavefront. As we said previously, future updates may enable automatic counting, but for now you can use following formulas for all three GCN GPU generations:

::

  compute_pgm_rsrc1_vgprs = (workitem_vgpr_count-1)/4

  compute_pgm_rsrc1_sgprs = (wavefront_sgpr_count-1)/8

Now consider the corresponding assembly:

::

  // initial state:
  //   s[0:1] - kernarg base address
  //   v0 - workitem id

  s_load_dwordx2  s[4:5], s[0:1], 0x10  // load out_ptr into s[4:5] from kernarg
  s_load_dwordx4  s[0:3], s[0:1], 0x00  // load in_ptr into s[0:1] and index_ptr into s[2:3] from kernarg
  v_lshlrev_b32  v0, 2, v0              // v0 *= 4;
  s_waitcnt     lgkmcnt(0)              // wait for memory reads to finish

  // compute address of corresponding element of index buffer
  // i.e. v[1:2] = &index[workitem_id]
  v_add_u32     v1, vcc, s2, v0
  v_mov_b32     v2, s3
  v_addc_u32    v2, vcc, v2, 0, vcc

  // compute address of corresponding element of in buffer
  // i.e. v[3:4] = &in[workitem_id]
  v_add_u32     v3, vcc, s0, v0
  v_mov_b32     v4, s1
  v_addc_u32    v4, vcc, v4, 0, vcc

  flat_load_dword  v1, v[1:2] // load index[workitem_id] into v1
  flat_load_dword  v2, v[3:4] // load in[workitem_id] into v2
  s_waitcnt     vmcnt(0) & lgkmcnt(0) // wait for memory reads to finish

  // v1 *= 4; ds_bpermute_b32 uses byte offset and registers are dwords
  v_lshlrev_b32  v1, 2, v1

  // perform permutation
  // temp[thread_id] = v2
  // v1 = temp[v1]
  // effectively we got v1 = in[index[thread_id]]
  ds_bpermute_b32  v1, v1, v2

  // compute address of corresponding element of out buffer
  // i.e. v[3:4] = &out[workitem_id]
  v_add_u32     v3, vcc, s4, v0
  v_mov_b32     v2, s5
  v_addc_u32    v4, vcc, v2, 0, vcc

  s_waitcnt     lgkmcnt(0) // wait for permutation to finish

  // store final value in out buffer, i.e. out[workitem_id] = v1
  flat_store_dword  v[3:4], v1

Compiling GCN ASM Kernel Into Hsaco
**************************************
The next step is to produce a Hsaco from the ASM source. LLVM has added support for the AMDGCN assembler, so you can use Clang to do all the necessary magic:

::

  clang -x assembler -target amdgcn--amdhsa -mcpu=fiji -c -o test.o asm_source.s

  clang -target amdgcn--amdhsa test.o -o test.co

The first command assembles an object file from the assembly source, and the second one links everything (you could have multiple source files) into a Hsaco. Now, you can load and run kernels from that Hsaco in a program. The `GitHub examples <https://github.com/RadeonOpenCompute/LLVM-AMDGPU-Assembler-Extra>`_ use Cmake to automatically compile ASM sources. In a future post we will cover DPP, another GCN cross-lane feature that allows vector instructions to grab operands from a neighboring lane.



GCN Assembler Tools
====================

Overview
********
This repository contains the following useful items related to AMDGPU ISA assembler:

   * amdphdrs: utility to convert ELF produced by llvm-mc into AMD Code Object (v1)
   * examples/asm-kernel: example of AMDGPU kernel code
   * examples/gfx8/ds_bpermute: transfer data between lanes in a wavefront with ds_bpermute_b32
   * examples/gfx8/dpp_reduce: calculate prefix sum in a wavefront with DPP instructions
   * examples/gfx8/s_memrealtime: use s_memrealtime instruction to create a delay
   * examples/gfx8/s_memrealtime_inline: inline assembly in OpenCL kernel version of s_memrealtime
   * examples/api/assemble: use LLVM API to assemble a kernel
   * examples/api/disassemble: use LLVM API to disassemble a stream of instructions
   * bin/sp3_to_mc.pl: script to convert some AMD sp3 legacy assembler syntax into LLVM MC
   * examples/sp3: examples of sp3 convertable code

At the time of this writing (February 2016), LLVM trunk build and latest ROCR runtime is needed.

LLVM trunk (May or later) now uses lld as linker and produces AMD Code Object (v2).

Building
*********
Top-level CMakeLists.txt is provided to build everything included. The following CMake variables should be set:

   * HSA_DIR (default /opt/hsa/bin): path to ROCR Runtime
   * LLVM_DIR: path to LLVM build directory

To build everything, create build directory and run cmake and make:

::

  mkdir build
  cd build  
  cmake -DLLVM_DIR=/srv/git/llvm.git/build ..
  make

Examples that require clang will only be built if clang is built as part of llvm.

Use cases
**********
**Assembling to code object with llvm-mc from command line**

The following llvm-mc command line produces ELF object asm.o from assembly source asm.s: ::

  llvm-mc -arch=amdgcn -mcpu=fiji -filetype=obj -o asm.o asm.s

**Assembling to raw instruction stream with llvm-mc from command line**

It is possible to extract contents of .text section after assembling to code object: ::

  llvm-mc -arch=amdgcn -mcpu=fiji -filetype=obj -o asm.o asm.s
  objdump -h asm.o | grep .text | awk '{print "dd if='asm.o' of='asm' bs=1 count=$[0x" $3 "] skip=$[0x" $6 "]"}' | bash

**Disassembling code object from command line**

The following command line may be used to dump contents of code object: ::

  llvm-objdump -disassemble -mcpu=fiji asm.o

This includes text disassembly of .text section.

**Disassembling raw instruction stream from command line**

The following command line may be used to disassemble raw instruction stream (without ELF structure): ::

  hexdump -v -e '/1 "0x%02X "' asm | llvm-mc -arch=amdgcn -mcpu=fiji -disassemble

Here, hexdump is used to display contents of file in hexadecimal (0x.. form) which is then consumed by llvm-mc.

Assembling source into code object using LLVM API
**************************************************
Refer to examples/api/assemble.

Disassembling instruction stream using LLVM API
**************************************************
Refer to examples/api/disassemble.

**Using amdphdrs**

Note that normally standard lld and Code Object version 2 should be used which is closer to standard ELF format.

amdphdrs (now obsolete) is complimentary utility that can be used to produce AMDGPU Code Object version 1.
For example, given assembly source in asm.s, the following will assemble it and link using amdphdrs: ::

  llvm-mc -arch=amdgcn -mcpu=fiji -filetype=obj -o asm.o asm.s
  andphdrs asm.o asm.co

Differences between LLVM AMDGPU Assembler and AMD SP3 assembler
****************************************************************
**Macro support**

SP3 supports proprietary set of macros/tools. sp3_to_mc.pl script attempts to translate them into GAS syntax understood by llvm-mc.
flat_atomic_cmpswap instruction has 32-bit destination

LLVM AMDGPU: ::

  flat_atomic_cmpswap v7, v[9:10], v[7:8]

SP3: ::

  flat_atomic_cmpswap v[7:8], v[9:10], v[7:8]

Atomic instructions that return value should have glc flag explicitly

LLVM AMDGPU: flat_atomic_swap_x2 v[0:1], v[0:1], v[2:3] glc

SP3 flat_atomic_swap_x2 v[0:1], v[0:1], v[2:3]

ROCr Debug Agent
================

The ROCr Debug Agent is a library that can be loaded by ROCm Platform
Runtime to provide the following functionality:

-  Print the state of wavefronts that report memory violation or upon
   executing a ``s_trap 2`` instruction.
-  Allows SIGINT (``ctrl c``) or SIGTERM (``kill -15``) to print
   wavefront state of aborted GPU dispatches.
-  It is enabled on Vega10 GPUs on ROCm1.9.1.

Usage
*****

To use the ROCr Debug Agent set the following environment variable:

.. code:: sh

   export HSA_TOOLS_LIB=librocr_debug_agent64.so

This will use the ROCr Debug Agent library installed at
/opt/rocm/lib/librocr_debug_agent64.so by default since the ROCm
installation adds /opt/rocm/lib to the system library path. To use a
different version set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH, for example:

.. code:: sh

   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path_to_directory_containing_librocr_debug_agent64.so

To display the machine code instructions of wavefronts, together with
the source text location, the ROCr Debug Agent uses the llvm-objdump
tool. Ensure that a version that supports AMD GCN GPUs is on your
’$PATH`. For example, for ROCm 1.9.1:

.. code:: sh

   export PATH=/opt/rocm/opencl/bin/x86_64/:$PATH

Execute your application.

If the application encounters a GPU error it will display the wavefront
state of the GPU to ``stdout``. Possible error states include:

-  The GPU executes a memory instruction that causes a memory violation.
   This is reported as an XNACK error state.
-  Queue error.
-  The GPU executes an ``S_TRAP`` instruction. The ``__builtin_trap()``
   language builtin can be used to generate a ``S_TRAP``.
-  A SIGINT (``ctrl c``) or SIGTERM (``kill -15``) signal is sent to the
   application while executing GPU code. Enabled by the
   ``ROCM_DEBUG_ENABLE_LINUX_SIGNALS`` environment variable.

For example, a sample print out for GPU memory fault is:

::

   Memory access fault by GPU agent: AMD gfx900
   Node: 1
   Address: 0x18DB4xxx (page not present;write access to a read-only page;)

   64 wavefront(s) found in XNACK error state @PC: 0x0000001100E01310

   Faulty PC offset: 1310

   Aborted (core dumped)

Options
*******

Dump Output
-----------

By default the wavefront dump is sent to ``stdout``.

To save to a file use:

.. code:: sh

   export ROCM_DEBUG_WAVE_STATE_DUMP=file

This will create a file called ``ROCm_Wave_State_Dump`` in code object
directory (see below).

To return to the default ``stdout`` use either of the following:

.. code:: sh

   export ROCM_DEBUG_WAVE_STATE_DUMP=stdout
   unset ROCM_DEBUG_WAVE_STATE_DUMP

Linux Signal Control
--------------------

The following environment variable can be used to enable dumping
wavefront states when SIGINT (``ctrl c``) or SIGTERM (``kill -15``) is
sent to the application:

.. code:: sh

   export ROCM_DEBUG_ENABLE_LINUX_SIGNALS=1

Either of the following will disable this behavior:

.. code:: sh

   export ROCM_DEBUG_ENABLE_LINUX_SIGNALS=0
   unset ROCM_DEBUG_ENABLE_LINUX_SIGNALS

Code Object Saving
------------------

When the ROCr Debug Agent is enabled, each GPU code object loaded by the
ROCm Platform Runtime will be saved in a file in the code object
directory. By default the code object directory is
``/tmp/ROCm_Tmp_PID_XXXX/`` where ``XXXX`` is the application process
ID. The code object directory can be specified using the following
environent variable:

.. code:: sh

   export ROCM_DEBUG_SAVE_CODE_OBJECT=code_object_directory

This will use the path ``/code_object_directory``.

Loaded code objects will be saved in files named ``ROCm_Code_Object_N``
where N is a unique integer starting at 0 of the order in which the code
object was loaded.

If the default code object directory is used, then the saved code object
file will be deleted when it is unloaded with the ROCm Platform Runtime,
and the complete code object directory will be deleted when the
application exits normally. If a code object directory path is specified
then neither the saved code objects, nor the code object directory will
be deleted.

To return to using the default code object directory use:

.. code:: sh

   unset ROCM_DEBUG_SAVE_CODE_OBJECT

Logging
-------

By default ROCr Debug Agent logging is disabled. It can be enabled to
display to ``stdout`` using:

.. code:: sh

   export ROCM_DEBUG_ENABLE_AGENTLOG=stdout

Or to a file using:

.. code:: sh

   export ROCM_DEBUG_ENABLE_AGENTLOG=<filename>

Which will write to the file ``<filename>_AgentLog_PID_XXXX.log``.

To disable logging use:

.. code:: sh

   unset ROCM_DEBUG_ENABLE_AGENTLOG

ROCm-GDB
=========

The ROCm-GDB is being revised to work with the ROCr Debug Agent to
support debugging GPU kernels on Radeon Open Compute platforms (ROCm)
and will be available in an upcoming release.

ROCm-Profiler
==============
Overview
********
The Radeon Compute Profiler (RCP) is a performance analysis tool that gathers data from the API run-time and GPU for OpenCL™ and ROCm/HSA applications. This information can be used by developers to discover bottlenecks in the application and to find ways to optimize the application's performance.

RCP was formerly delivered as part of CodeXL with the executable name "CodeXLGpuProfiler". Prior to its inclusion in CodeXL, it was known as "sprofile" and was part of the AMD APP Profiler product.

A subset of RCP is (the portion that supports ROCm) is automatically installed with ROCm. Once ROCm is installed, the profiler will appear in the /opt/rocm/profiler directory.

Major Features
***************
   * Measure the execution time of an OpenCL™ or ROCm/HSA kernel.
   * Query the hardware performance counters on an AMD Radeon graphics card.
   * Use the CXLActivityLogger API to trace and measure the execution of segments in the program.
   * Display the IL/HSAIL and ISA (hardware disassembly) code of OpenCL™ kernels.
   * Calculate kernel occupancy information, which estimates the number of in-flight wavefronts on a compute unit as a percentage of 	  the theoretical maximum number of wavefronts that the compute unit can support.
     When used with CodeXL, all profiler data can be visualized in a user-friendly graphical user interface.

What's New
**********
   * Version 5.1 (6/28/17)
       * Adds support for additional GPUs, including Vega series GPUs
       * ROCm/HSA: Support for ROCm 1.9.1
       * Improves display of pointer parameters for some HSA APIs in the ATP file
       * Fixes an issue with parsing an ATP file which has non-ascii characters (affected Summary page generation and display within 		 CodeXL)

System Requirements
********************
  * An AMD Radeon GCN-based GPU or APU
  * Radeon Software Crimson ReLive Edition 17.4.3 or later (Driver Packaging Version 17.10 or later).
      *  For Vega support, a driver with Driver Packaging Version 17.20 or later is required
  * ROCm 1.9.1 See system requirements for ROCm: https://rocm-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Installation_Guide/Installation-Guide.html and https://rocm.github.io/hardware.html.
  * Windows 7, 8.1, and 10
      *  For Windows, the Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015 is required. It can be downloaded from https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145
  * Ubuntu (14.04 and later, 16.04 or later for ROCm support) and RHEL (7 and later) distributions

Why version 5.x?
******************
Although the Radeon Compute Profiler is a newly-branded tool, the technology contained in it has been around for several years. RCP has its roots in the AMD APP Profiler product, which progressed from version 1.x to 3.x. Then the profiler was included in CodeXL, and the codebase was labelled as version 4.x. Now that RCP is being pulled out of CodeXL and into its own codebase again, we've bumped the version number up to 5.x.

Known Issues
**************
   * For the OpenCL™ Profiler
       * Collecting Performance Counters for an OpenCL™ application is not currently working for Vega GPUs on Windows when using a 	    17.20-based driver. This is due to missing driver support in the 17.20 driver. Future driver versions should provide the 	 	 support needed.
       * Collecting Performance Counters using --perfcounter for an OpenCL™ application when running OpenCL-on-ROCm is not suported 		 currently. The workaround is to profile using the ROCm profiler (using the --hsapmc command-line switch).
   * For the ROCm Profiler
       * API Trace and Perf Counter data may be truncated or missing if the application being profiled does not call hsa_shut_down
       *  Kernel occupancy information will only be written to disk if the application being profiled calls hsa_shut_down
       * When collecting a trace for an application that performs memory transfers using hsa_amd_memory_async_copy, if the 		 application asks for the data transfer timestamps directly, it will not get correct timestamps. The profiler will show the 		 correct timestamps, however.
       * When collecting an aql packet trace, if the application asks for the kernel dispatch timestamps directly, it will not get 		 correct timestamps. The profiler will show the correct timestamps, however.
       * When the rocm-profiler package (.deb or .rpm) is installed along with rocm, it may not be able to generate the default 	 single-pass counter files. If you do not see counter files in /opt/rocm/profiler/counterfiles, you can generate them 		 manually with this command: "sudo /opt/rocm/profiler/bin/CodeXLGpuProfiler --list --outputfile /opt/rocm/profiler/	  	   counterfiles/counters --maxpassperfile 1"

GPUperfAPI
==============

The GPU Performance API (GPUPerfAPI, or GPA) is a powerful library, providing access to GPU Performance Counters. It can help analyze the performance and execution characteristics of applications using a Radeon™ GPU. This library is used by both CodeXL and GPU PerfStudio.

Major Features
###############

   * Provides a standard API for accessing GPU Performance counters for both graphics and compute workloads across multiple GPU APIs.
   * Supports DirectX11, OpenGL, OpenGLES, OpenCL™, and ROCm/HSA
   * Developer Preview for DirectX12 (no hardware-based performance counter support yet)
   * Supports all current GCN-based Radeon graphics cards and APUs.
   * Supports both Windows and Linux
   * Provides derived "public" counters based on raw HW counters
   * "Internal" version provides access to some raw hardware counters. See "Public" vs "Internal" Versions for more information.

What's New
##########
    Version 2.23 (6/27/17)
     * Add support for additional GPUs, including Vega series GPUs
     * Allow unit tests to be built and run on Linux

System Requirements
#####################
    * An AMD Radeon GCN-based GPU or APU
    * Radeon Software Crimson ReLive Edition 17.4.3 or later (Driver Packaging Version 17.10 or later).
       * For Vega support, a driver with Driver Packaging Version 17.20 or later is required
    * Pre-GCN-based GPUs or APUs are no longer supported by GPUPerfAPI. Please use an older version (2.17) with older hardware.
    * Windows 7, 8.1, and 10
    * Ubuntu (16.04 and later) and RHEL (7 and later) distributions

Public" vs "Internal" Versions
###############################
This open source release supports building both the "Public" and "Internal" versions of GPUPerfAPI. By default the Visual Studio solution and the Linux build scripts will produce what is referred to as the "Public" version of GPUPerfAPI. This version exposes "Public", or "Derived", counters. These are counters that are computed using a set of hardware counters. Until now, only the Public the version of GPUPerfAPI was available on the AMD Developer website. As part of the open-source effort, we are also providing the ability to build the "Internal" versions of GPUPerfAPI. In addition to exposing the same counters as the Public version, the Internal version also exposes some of the hardware Counters available in the GPU/APU. It's important to note that not all hardware counters receive the same validation as other parts of the hardware on all GPUs, so in some cases accuracy of counter data cannot be guaranteed. The usage of the Internal version is identical to the Public version. The only difference will be in the name of the library an application loads at runtime and the list of counters exposed by the library. See the Build Instructions for more information on how to build and use the Internal version. In the future, we see there being only a single version of GPUPerfAPI, with perhaps a change in the API to allow users of GPA to indicate whether the library exposes just the Derived counters or both the Derived and the Hardware counters. We realize using the term "Internal" for something which is no longer actually Internal-to-AMD can be a bit confusing, and we will aim to change this in the future.

Known Issues
#############
  *  The OpenCL™ version of GPUPerfAPI requires at least Driver Version 17.30.1071 for Vega GPUs on Windows. Earlier driver versions have      	    either missing or incomplete support for collecting OpenCL performance counters
