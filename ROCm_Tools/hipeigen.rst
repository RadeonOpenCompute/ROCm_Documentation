Installation instructions for ROCm
**************************************
The ROCm Platform brings a rich foundation to advanced computing by seamlessly integrating the CPU and GPU with the goal of solving real-world problems.

To insatll rocm, please follow:

Installing from AMD ROCm repositories
**************************************
AMD is hosting both debian and rpm repositories for the ROCm 1.9.1 packages. The packages in both repositories have been signed to ensure package integrity. Directions for each repository are given below:

* Debian repository - apt-get
* Add the ROCm apt repository

Complete installation steps of ROCm can be found `Here <https://rocm-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Installation_Guide/Installation-Guide.html>`_

or 

For Debian based systems, like Ubuntu, configure the Debian ROCm repository as follows:

::

  wget -qO - http://packages.amd.com/rocm/apt/debian/rocm.gpg.key | sudo apt-key add -
  sudo sh -c 'echo deb [arch=amd64] http://packages.amd.com/rocm/apt/debian/ xenial main > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/rocm.list'

The gpg key might change, so it may need to be updated when installing a new release.

**Install or Update**


Next, update the apt-get repository list and install/update the rocm package:

 .. WARNING::
       Before proceeding, make sure to completely uninstall any pre-release ROCm packages

::
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install rocm


Then, make the ROCm kernel your default kernel. If using grub2 as your bootloader, you can edit the GRUB_DEFAULT variable in the following file:

:: 
  sudo vi /etc/default/grub
  sudo update-grub

Once complete, **reboot your system.**

We recommend you verify your installation to make sure everything completed successfully.

Installation instructions for Eigen
*********************************
Explanation before starting
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Eigen consists only of header files, hence there is nothing to compile before you can use it. Moreover, these header files do not depend on your platform, they are the same for everybody.

**Method 1. Installing without using CMake**

You can use right away the headers in the Eigen/ subdirectory. In order to install, just copy this Eigen/ subdirectory to your favorite location. If you also want the unsupported features, copy the unsupported/ subdirectory too.

**Method 2. Installing using CMake**

Let's call this directory 'source_dir' (where this INSTALL file is). Before starting, create another directory which we will call 'build_dir'.

Do:
::

  cd build_dir
  cmake source_dir
  make install

The make install step may require administrator privileges.

You can adjust the installation destination (the "prefix") by passing the -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=myprefix option to cmake, as is explained in the message that cmake prints at the end.

Build and Run hipeigen direct tests
*************************************
To build the direct tests for hipeigen:
::
  cd build_dir
  make check -j $(nproc)


Note: All direct tests should pass with ROCm1.9.1
