========================
ROCm™ Data Center Tool
========================

The ROCm™ Data Center Tool™ simplifies the administration and addresses key infrastructure challenges in AMD GPUs in cluster and datacenter environments. The main features are:

- GPU telemetry 

- GPU statistics for jobs

- Integration with third-party tools

- Open source

The tool can be used in stand-alone mode if all components are installed. However, the existing management tools can use the same set of features available in a library format. 

Refer to the Starting RDC section in the ROCm Data Center Tool User Guide for details on different modes of operation.

Objective
=========

This user guide is intended to:

•	Provide an overview of the ROCm Data Center Tool features
•	Describe how system administrators and Data Center (or HPC) users can administer and configure AMD GPUs
•	Describe the components 
•	Provide an overview of the open source developer handbook

Target Audience
================

The audience for the AMD ROCm Data Center™ tool consists of: 
 
•	Administrators: The tool will provide cluster administrator with the capability of monitoring, validating, and configuring policies.
