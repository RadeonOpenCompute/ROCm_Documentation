Introduction
*************

An implementation of Lapack routines on top of AMD’s Radeon Open Compute Platform (ROCm) runtime and toolchains. 
rocSOLVER is implemented in the HIP programming language; it is based on rocBLAS, an optimized BLAS 
implementation for AMD’s latest discrete GPUs. More information about rocBLAS can be found 
`here <https://rocblas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_.

Build and install
===================

rocSOLVER requires `cmake <https://cmake.org/install/>`_ 
and `ROCm <https://rocm.github.io/install.html>`_, including 
`hip <https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/HIP/blob/master/INSTALL.md>`_ and 
`rocBLAS <https://github.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/rocBLAS>`_, to be installed. 

Once these requirements are satisfied, the following
instructions will build and install rocSOLVER:

.. code-block:: bash
   
     mkdir build && cd build
    CXX=/opt/rocm/bin/hcc cmake ..
    make
    make install

Brief description and functionality
====================================

rocSolver Library is in early stages of active development. New features and functionality is being continuosly added. New 
functionality is documented at each release of the ROCm platform. 

The following table summarizes the LAPACK functionality implemented in rocSOLVER's last release.

Benchmarking and testing
==========================

Additionally, rocSOLVER has a basic/preliminary infrastructure for testing and benchmarking similar to that of rocBLAS. 

On a normal installation, clients should be located in the directory **<rocsolverDIR>/build/clients/staging**. 

**rocsolver-test** executes a suite of `Google tests <https://github.com/google/googletest>`_ (*gtest*) that verifies the correct
functioning of the library; the results computed by rocSOLVER, for random input data, are compared with the results computed by 
`NETLib LAPACK <http://www.netlib.org/lapack/>`_ on the CPU.

Calling the rocSOLVER gtest client with the --help flag

.. code-block:: bash
    
    ./rocsolver-test --help

returns information on different flags that control the behavior of the gtests.   

**rocsolver-bench** allows to run any rocSOLVER function with random data of the specified dimensions; it compares the computed results, and provides basic
performance information (as for now, execution times). 

Similarly, 

.. code-block:: bash
    
    ./rocsolver-bench --help

returns information on how to use the rocSOLVER benchmark client.
