  * \class MultiGrid
  * \brief MultiGrid Method
  * \details
  * The MultiGrid method can be used with external data, such as externally computed
  * restriction, prolongation and operator hierarchy. The user need to pass all this
  * information for each level and for its construction. This includes smoothing step,
  * prolongation/restriction, grid traversing and coarse grid solver. This data need
  * to be passed to the solver.
  * \cite Trottenberg2003
  * - Restriction and prolongation operations can be performed in two ways, based on
  *   Restriction() and Prolongation() of the LocalVector class, or by matrix-vector
  *   multiplication. This is configured by a set function.
  * - Smoothers can be of any iterative linear solver. Valid options are Jacobi,
  *   Gauss-Seidel, ILU, etc. using a FixedPoint iteration scheme with pre-defined number
  *   of iterations. The smoothers could also be a solver such as CG, BiCGStab, etc.
  * - Coarse grid solver could be of any iterative linear solver type. The class also
  *   provides mechanisms to specify, where the coarse grid solver has to be performed,
  *   on the host or on the accelerator. The coarse grid solver can be preconditioned.
  * - Grid scaling based on a \f$L_2\f$ norm ratio.
  * - Operator matrices need to be passed on each grid level.
  *
  * \tparam OperatorType - can be LocalMatrix or GlobalMatrix
  * \tparam VectorType - can be LocalVector or GlobalVector
  * \tparam ValueType - can be float, double, std::complex<float> or std::complex<double>
