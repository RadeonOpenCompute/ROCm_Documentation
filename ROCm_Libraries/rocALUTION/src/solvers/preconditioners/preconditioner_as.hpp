  * linear system \f$Ax=b\f$ can be decomposed into small sub-problems based on
  * \f$A_{i} = R_{i}^{T}AR_{i}\f$, where \f$R_{i}\f$ are restriction operators. Those
  * restriction operators produce sub-matrices wich overlap. This leads to contributions
  * from two preconditioners on the overlapped area which are scaled by \f$1/2\f$.
