Installation instructions for ROCm
#####################################
The ROCm Platform brings a rich foundation to advanced computing by seamlessly integrating the CPU and GPU with the goal of solving real-world problems.

To insatll rocm, please follow:

Installing from AMD ROCm repositories
#########################################
AMD is hosting both debian and rpm repositories for the ROCm 2.7 packages. The packages in both repositories have been signed to ensure package integrity. Directions for each repository are given below:

* Debian repository - apt-get
* Add the ROCm apt repository

Complete installation steps of ROCm can be found `Here <https://rocm-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Installation_Guide/Installation-Guide.html>`_

or 

For Debian based systems, like Ubuntu, configure the Debian ROCm repository as follows:

::

  curl -fsSL https://repo.radeon.com/rocm/rocm.gpg.key | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/rocm-archive-keyring.gpg
  sudo sh -c 'echo deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/rocm-archive-keyring.gpg] http://packages.amd.com/rocm/apt/debian/ xenial main > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/rocm.list'

The gpg key might change, so it may need to be updated when installing a new release.

**Install or Update**


Next, update the apt-get repository list and install/update the rocm package:

 .. WARNING::
       Before proceeding, make sure to completely uninstall any pre-release ROCm packages

::

  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install rocm


Then, make the ROCm kernel your default kernel. If using grub2 as your bootloader, you can edit the GRUB_DEFAULT variable in the following file:

::

  sudo vi /etc/default/grub
  sudo update-grub

Once complete, **reboot your system.**

We recommend you verify your installation to make sure everything completed successfully.

Installation instructions for Eigen
#########################################
**Explanation before starting**

Eigen consists only of header files, hence there is nothing to compile before you can use it. Moreover, these header files do not depend on your platform, they are the same for everybody.

**Method 1. Installing without using CMake**

You can use right away the headers in the Eigen/ subdirectory. In order to install, just copy this Eigen/ subdirectory to your favorite location. If you also want the unsupported features, copy the unsupported/ subdirectory too.

**Method 2. Installing using CMake**

Let's call this directory 'source_dir' (where this INSTALL file is). Before starting, create another directory which we will call 'build_dir'.

Do:
::

  cd build_dir
  cmake source_dir
  make install

The make install step may require administrator privileges.

You can adjust the installation destination (the "prefix") by passing the -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=myprefix option to cmake, as is explained in the message that cmake prints at the end.

Build and Run hipeigen direct tests
#########################################
To build the direct tests for hipeigen:
::
  cd build_dir
  make check -j $(nproc)


Note: All direct tests should pass with ROCm 2.7


.. _CLFF:

clFFT
*******

For Github Repository `clFFT <https://github.com/clMathLibraries/clFFT>`_

clFFT is a software library containing FFT functions written in OpenCL. In addition to GPU devices, the library also supports running on CPU devices to facilitate debugging and heterogeneous programming.

Pre-built binaries are available `here <https://github.com/clMathLibraries/clFFT/releases>`_.

What's New
###########

    * Support for powers of 11&13 size transforms
    * Support for 1D large size transforms with no extra memory allocation requirement with environment flag CLFFT_REQUEST_LIB_NOMEMALLOC=1 for complex FFTs of powers of 2,3,5,10 sizes

Note
-----

    * clFFT requires platform/runtime that supports OpenCL 1.2


Introduction to clFFT
############################
The FFT is an implementation of the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) that makes use of symmetries in the FFT definition to reduce the mathematical intensity required from O(N^2) to O(N log2(N)) when the sequence length N is the product of small prime factors. Currently, there is no standard API for FFT routines. Hardware vendors usually provide a set of high-performance FFTs optimized for their systems: no two vendors employ the same interfaces for their FFT routines. clFFT provides a set of FFT routines that are optimized for AMD graphics processors, but also are functional across CPU and other compute devices.

The clFFT library is an open source OpenCL library implementation of discrete Fast Fourier Transforms. The library:

 * provides a fast and accurate platform for calculating discrete FFTs.

 * works on CPU or GPU backends.

 * supports in-place or out-of-place transforms.

 * supports 1D, 2D, and 3D transforms with a batch size that can be greater than 1.

 * supports planar (real and complex components in separate arrays) and interleaved (real and complex components as a pair contiguous in memory) formats.

 * supports dimension lengths that can be any combination of powers of 2, 3, 5, 7, 11 and 13.

 * Supports single and double precision floating point formats.

For Github repository `clBLAS <https://github.com/clMathLibraries/clBLAS>`_

This repository houses the code for the OpenCL™ BLAS portion of clMath. The complete set of BLAS level 1, 2 & 3 routines is implemented. Please see Netlib BLAS for the list of supported routines. In addition to GPU devices, the library also supports running on CPU devices to facilitate debugging and multicore programming. APPML 1.12 is the most current generally available pre-packaged binary version of the library available for download for both Linux and Windows platforms.

The primary goal of clBLAS is to make it easier for developers to utilize the inherent performance and power efficiency benefits of heterogeneous computing. clBLAS interfaces do not hide nor wrap OpenCL interfaces, but rather leaves OpenCL state management to the control of the user to allow for maximum performance and flexibility. The clBLAS library does generate and enqueue optimized OpenCL kernels, relieving the user from the task of writing, optimizing and maintaining kernel code themselves.

**clBLAS update notes 01/2017**

v2.12 is a bugfix release as a rollup of all fixes in /develop branch
Thanks to @pavanky, @iotamudelta, @shahsan10, @psyhtest, @haahh, @hughperkins, @tfauck @abhiShandy, @IvanVergiliev, @zougloub, @mgates3 for contributions to clBLAS v2.12

True in spirit with the other clMath libraries, clSPARSE exports a “C” interface to allow projects to build wrappers around clSPARSE in any language they need. A great deal of thought and effort went into designing the API’s to make them less ‘cluttered’ compared to the older clMath libraries. OpenCL state is not explicitly passed through the API, which enables the library to be forward compatible when users are ready to switch from OpenCL 1.2 to OpenCL 2.0 3

API semantic versioning
##############################
Good software is typically the result of iteration and feedback. clSPARSE follows the `semantic <http://semver.org/>`_ versioning guidelines, and while the major version number remains '0', the public API should not be considered stable. We release clSPARSE as beta software (0.y.z) early to the community to elicit feedback and comment. This comes with the expectation that with feedback, we may incorporate breaking changes to the API that might require early users to recompile, or rewrite portions of their code as we iterate on the design.

**clSPARSE Wiki**

The `project wiki <https://github.com/clMathLibraries/clSPARSE/wiki>`_ contains helpful documentation.
A `build primer <https://github.com/clMathLibraries/clSPARSE/wiki/Build>`_ is available, which describes how to use cmake to generate platforms specific build files

**Samples**

clSPARSE contains a directory of simple `OpenCL samples <https://github.com/clMathLibraries/clSPARSE/tree/master/samples>`_ that demonstrate the use of the API in both C and C++. The `superbuild <https://blog.kitware.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/kitware_quarterly1009.pdf>`_ script for clSPARSE also builds the samples as an external project, to demonstrate how an application would find and link to clSPARSE with cmake.

**clSPARSE library documentation**

API documentation is available at http://clmathlibraries.github.io/clSPARSE/. The samples give an excellent starting point to basic library operations.

**Contributing code**

Please refer to and read the `Contributing <https://github.com/clMathLibraries/clSPARSE/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md>`_ document for guidelines on how to contribute code to this open source project. Code in the /master branch is considered to be stable and new library releases are made when commits are merged into /master. Active development and pull-requests should be made to the develop branch.

.. _CLR:

****************
clRNG
****************
 
For Github repository `clRNG <https://github.com/clMathLibraries/clRNG>`_

A library for uniform random number generation in OpenCL.

Streams of random numbers act as virtual random number generators. They can be created on the host computer in unlimited numbers, and then used either on the host or on computing devices by work items to generate random numbers. Each stream also has equally-spaced substreams, which are occasionally useful. The API is currently implemented for four different RNGs, namely the MRG31k3p, MRG32k3a, LFSR113 and Philox-4×32-10 generators.


What's New
##############
Libraries related to clRNG, for probability distributions and quasi-Monte Carlo methods, are available:

 * `clProbDist <https://github.com/umontreal-simul/clProbDist>`_
 * `clQMC <https://github.com/umontreal-simul/clQMC>`_

**Releases**

The first public version of clRNG is v1.0.0 beta. Please go to `releases <https://github.com/clMathLibraries/clRNG/releases>`_ for downloads.

Building
##############
 1. Install the runtime dependency:
      * An OpenCL SDK, such as APP SDK.
 
 2. Install the build dependencies:

     * The CMake cross-platform build system. Visual Studio users can use CMake Tools for Visual Studio.
     * A recent C compiler, such as `GCC 4.9 <https://gcc.gnu.org/>`_ , or Visual Studio 2013.

 3. Get the clRNG source code.

 4. Configure the project using `CMake <https://cmake.org/>`_ (to generate standard makefiles) or `CMake Tools for Visual Studio <https://cmaketools.codeplex.com/>`_ (to generate solution and project files).

 5. Build the project.

 6. Install the project (by default, the library will be installed in the package directory under the build directory).

 7. Point the environment variable CLRNG_ROOT to the installation directory, i.e., the directory under which include/clRNG can be   	found. This step is optional if the library is installed under /usr, which is the default.

 8. In order to execute the example programs (under the bin subdirectory of the installation directory) or to link clRNG into other 	software, the dynamic linker must be informed where to find the clRNG shared library. The name and location of the shared library 	  generally depend on the platform.

 9. Optionally run the tests.

Example Instructions for Linux
#####################################
On a 64-bit Linux platform, steps 3 through 9 from above, executed in a Bash-compatible shell, could consist of:

::

  git clone https://github.com/clMathLibraries/clRNG.git
  mkdir clRNG.build; cd clRNG.build; cmake ../clRNG/src
  make
  make install
  export CLRNG_ROOT=$PWD/package
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$CLRNG_ROOT/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  $CLRNG_ROOT/bin/CTest
  
**Examples**

Examples can be found in src/client. The compiled client program examples can be found under the bin subdirectory of the installation package ($CLRNG_ROOT/bin under Linux). Note that the examples expect an OpenCL GPU device to be available.

Installation
###############

The following are the steps to use the library

 * ROCM 2.7 Kernel, Driver and Compiler Installation (if not done until now)
 * Library installation.

**ROCM 2.7 Installation**

To Know more about ROCM refer 
https://github.com/RadeonOpenCompute/ROCm/blob/master/README.md

**a. Installing Debian ROCM repositories**

Before proceeding, make sure to completely uninstall any pre-release ROCm packages.

Refer https://github.com/RadeonOpenCompute/ROCm#removing-pre-release-packages for instructions to remove pre-release ROCM packages.

Steps to install rocm package are,

::

  curl -fsSL https://repo.radeon.com/rocm/rocm.gpg.key | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/rocm-archive-keyring.gpg

  sudo sh -c 'echo deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/rocm-archive-keyring.gpg] http://packages.amd.com/rocm/apt/debian/ xenial main > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/rocm.list'

  sudo apt-get update

  sudo apt-get install rocm

Then, make the ROCm kernel your default kernel. If using grub2 as your bootloader, you can edit the GRUB_DEFAULT variable in the following file:


::

  sudo vi /etc/default/grub

  sudo update-grub

and Reboot the system

**b. Verifying the Installation**

Once Reboot, to verify that the ROCm stack completed successfully you can execute HSA vector_copy sample application:

   * cd /opt/rocm/hsa/sample        
   * make       
   * ./vector_copy

**Library Installation**

**a. Install using Prebuilt debian**

::

  wget https://github.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/hcFFT/blob/master/pre-builds/hcfft-master-87a37f5-Linux.deb
  sudo dpkg -i hcfft-master-87a37f5-Linux.deb

**b. Build debian from source**

::

  git clone https://github.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/hcFFT.git && cd hcFFT

  chmod +x build.sh && ./build.sh

build.sh execution builds the library and generates a debian under build directory.

**c. Install CPU based FFTW3 library**

::

  sudo apt-get install fftw3 fftw3-dev pkg-config
