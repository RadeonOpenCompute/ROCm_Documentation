HIP Installation v5.0
=======================

HIP can be easily installed using the pre-built binary packages with the package manager for your platform.

**Note**: The version definition for the HIP runtime is different from CUDA. On the AMD platform, the function returns the HIP runtime version, while on the NVIDIA platform, it returns the CUDA runtime version. There is no mapping or correlation between the HIP version and CUDA version.


HIP Prerequisites
====================

HIP code can be developed either on AMD ROCm platform using HIP-Clang compiler, or a CUDA platform with NVCC installed.



AMD Platform
===============

::

   sudo apt install mesa-common-dev
   sudo apt install clang
   sudo apt install comgr
   sudo apt-get -y install rocm-dkms
   

HIP-Clang is the compiler for compiling HIP programs on AMD platform.

HIP-Clang can be built manually:

::

   	git clone -b rocm-5.0.x https://github.com/RadeonOpenCompute/llvm-project.git
	cd llvm-project
	mkdir -p build && cd build
	cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/rocm/llvm -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DLLVM_ENABLE_ASSERTIONS=1 - 
	DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD="AMDGPU;X86" - DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS="clang;lld;compiler-rt" ../llvm
	make -j
	sudo make install


::

The ROCm device library can be manually built as following,

::

  	export PATH=/opt/rocm/llvm/bin:$PATH
	git clone -b rocm-5.0.x https://github.com/RadeonOpenCompute/ROCm-Device-Libs.git
	cd ROCm-Device-Libs
	mkdir -p build && cd build
	CC=clang CXX=clang++ cmake -DLLVM_DIR=/opt/rocm/llvm -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DLLVM_ENABLE_WERROR=1 -DLLVM_ENABLE_ASSERTIONS=1 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/rocm ..
	make -j
	sudo make install

::


NVIDIA Platform
=================

HIP-nvcc is the compiler for HIP program compilation on NVIDIA platform.

Install NVIDIA Driver
-----------------------

::
		sudo apt-get install ubuntu-drivers-common && sudo ubuntu-drivers autoinstall
		sudo reboot


Or download the latest cuda-toolkit at https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads

The driver will be installed automatically.

* Add the ROCm package server to your system as per the OS-specific guide available [here](https://rocm.github.io/ROCmInstall.html#installing-from-amd-rocm-repositories).
* Install the "hip-runtime-nvidia" and "hip-dev" package.  This will install CUDA SDK and the HIP porting layer.



::

		apt-get install hip-runtime-nvidia hip-dev
		
 			

-  Default paths and environment variables:

   -  By default HIP looks for CUDA SDK in /usr/local/cuda (can be overriden by setting CUDA_PATH env variable).

   -  By default HIP is installed into /opt/rocm/hip (can be overridden by setting HIP_PATH environment variable).

   -  Optionally, consider adding /opt/rocm/bin to your path to make it easier to use the tools.


Building HIP from Source on AMD Platform
=========================================


Get HIP source code
*********************

::

		git clone -b rocm-5.0.x https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/hipamd.git
		git clone -b rocm-5.0.x https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/hip.git
		git clone -b rocm-5.0.x https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/ROCclr.git
		git clone -b rocm-5.0.x https://github.com/RadeonOpenCompute/ROCm-OpenCL-Runtime.git
		


Set environment variables
******************************

::

		export HIPAMD_DIR="$(readlink -f hipamd)"
		export HIP_DIR="$(readlink -f hip)"
		export ROCclr_DIR="$(readlink -f ROCclr)"
		export OPENCL_DIR="$(readlink -f ROCm-OpenCL-Runtime)"
		

ROCclr is defined on AMD platform that HIP use Radeon Open Compute Common Language Runtime (ROCclr), which is a virtual device interface that HIP runtimes interact with different backends. 

See https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/ROCclr

HIPAMD repository provides implementation specifically for AMD platform. See https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/hipamd


Build HIP
*********

::

		cd "$HIPAMD_DIR"
		mkdir -p build; cd build
		cmake -DHIP_COMMON_DIR=$HIP_DIR -DAMD_OPENCL_PATH=$OPENCL_DIR -DROCCLR_PATH=$ROCCLR_DIR -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="/opt/rocm/" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$PWD/install ..
		make -j$(nproc)
		sudo make install

**Note**: If you don't specify CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX, hip runtime will be installed to "/opt/rocm/hip". By default, release version of AMDHIP is built.


Default paths and environment variables
******************************************

- By default HIP looks for HSA in /opt/rocm/hsa (can be overridden by setting HSA_PATH environment variable).

- By default HIP is installed into /opt/rocm/hip (can be overridden by setting HIP_PATH environment variable).

- By default HIP looks for clang in /opt/rocm/llvm/bin (can be overridden by setting HIP_CLANG_PATH environment variable)

- By default HIP looks for device library in /opt/rocm/lib (can be overridden by setting DEVICE_LIB_PATH environment variable)

- Optionally, consider adding /opt/rocm/bin to your PATH to make it easier to use the tools

- Optionally, set HIPCC_VERBOSE=7 to output the command line for compilation

After installation, make sure HIP_PATH is pointed to /where/to/install/hip


Building HIP from Source on NVIDIA Platform
=============================================

Get HIP source code
*********************

::

		git clone -b rocm-5.0.x https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/hip.git
		git clone -b rocm-5.0.x https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/hipamd.git



Set environment variables
****************************

::

		export HIP_DIR="$(readlink -f hip)"
		export HIPAMD_DIR="$(readlink -f hipamd)"




Build HIP
***********

::
			
			cd "$HIPAMD_DIR"
			mkdir -p build; cd build
			cmake -DHIP_COMMON_DIR=$HIP_DIR -DHIP_PLATFORM=nvidia -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$PWD/install ..
			make -j$(nproc)
			sudo make install


Verify your installation
**************************

Run hipconfig (instructions below assume default installation path):

::

		shell
		<ROCM_PATH>/bin/hipconfig --full

		or

		shell
		$PWD/install/bin/hipconfig --full


Compile and run the [square sample](https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/HIP/tree/rocm-5.0.x/samples/0_Intro/square).
