Deprecations
===============

ROCm Release v4.5
-------------------

AMD Instinct MI25 End of Life
===============================

ROCm release v4.5 is the final release to support AMD Instinct MI25. AMD Instinct MI25 has reached End of Life (EOL). ROCm 4.5 represents the last certified release for software and driver support. AMD will continue to provide technical support and issue resolution for AMD Instinct MI25 on ROCm v4.5 for a period of 12 months from the software GA date.

Planned Deprecation of Code Object Versions 2 AND 3
========================================================

With the ROCm v4.5 release, the generation of code object versions 2 and 3 is being deprecated and may be removed in a future release. This deprecation notice does not impact support for the execution of AMD GPU code object versions.

The -mcode-object-version Clang option can be used to instruct the compiler to generate a specific AMD GPU code object version. In ROCm v4.5, the compiler can generate AMD GPU code object version 2, 3, and 4, with version 4 being the default if not specified.


ROCm Release v4.1
--------------------

COMPILER-GENERATED CODE OBJECT VERSION 2 DEPRECATION 
=======================================================

Compiler-generated code object version 2 is no longer supported and has been completely removed. 

Support for loading code object version 2 is also deprecated with no announced removal release.


Changed HIP Environment Variables in ROCm v4.1 Release
=======================================================

In the ROCm v3.5 release, the Heterogeneous Compute Compiler (HCC) compiler was deprecated, and the HIP-Clang compiler was introduced for compiling Heterogeneous-Compute Interface for Portability (HIP) programs. Also, the HIP runtime API was implemented on top of the Radeon Open Compute Common Language runtime (ROCclr). ROCclr is an abstraction layer that provides the ability to interact with different runtime backends such as ROCr. 

While the *HIP_PLATFORM=hcc* environment variable was functional in subsequent releases after ROCm v3.5, in the ROCm v4.1 release, changes to the following environment variables were implemented: 

* *HIP_PLATFORM=hcc was changed to HIP_PLATFORM=amd*

* *HIP_PLATFORM=nvcc was changed to HIP_PLATFORM=nvidia*

Therefore, any applications continuing to use the HIP_PLATFORM=hcc environment variable will fail.

**Workaround:**  Update the environment variables to reflect the changes mentioned above.



ROCm Release v4.0
--------------------

Deprecated ROCr Runtime Structs
================================

* hsa_callback_data_t

* hsa_code_symbol_t


AOMP DEPRECATION
===================

As of AMD ROCm v4.0, AOMP (aomp-amdgpu) is deprecated. OpenMP support has moved to the openmp-extras auxiliary package, which leverages the ROCm compiler on LLVM 12.

ROCm Release v3.5
--------------------

Heterogeneous Compute Compiler
==================================
