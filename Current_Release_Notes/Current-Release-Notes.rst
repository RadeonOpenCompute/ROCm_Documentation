What's New in This Release
==========================

Upgrading to This Release
---------------------------

You must perform a fresh and a clean AMD ROCm install to successfully
upgrade from v3.3 to v3.5. The following changes apply in this release:

-  HCC is deprecated and replaced with the HIP-Clang compiler
-  HIP-HCC runtime is changed to Radeon Open Compute Common Language
   Runtime (HIP-ROCClr)
-  In the v3.5 release, the firmware is separated from the kernel
   package. The difference is as follows:

   -  v3.5 release has two separate rock-dkms and rock-dkms-firmware
      packages
   -  v3.3 release had the firmware as part of the rock-dkms package
   


rocProf Command Line Tool Python Requirement
----------------------------------------------

SQLite3 is a required Python module for the rocprof command-line tool.  You can install the SQLite3 Python module using the pip utility and set env var ROCP_PYTHON_VERSION to the Python version, which includes the SQLite3 module.



Heterogeneous-Compute Interface for Portability
--------------------------------------------------

In this release, the Heterogeneous Compute Compiler (HCC) compiler is
deprecated and the HIP-Clang compiler is introduced for compiling
Heterogeneous-Compute Interface for Portability (HIP) programs.

NOTE: The HCC environment variables will be gradually deprecated in
subsequent releases.

The majority of the codebase for the HIP-Clang compiler has been
upstreamed to the Clang trunk. The HIP-Clang implementation has
undergone a strict code review by the LLVM/Clang community and
comprehensive tests consisting of LLVM/Clang build bots. These reviews
and tests resulted in higher productivity, code quality, and lower cost
of maintenance.

.. figure:: HIPClang2.png
   :alt: ScreenShot

   

For most HIP applications, the transition from HCC to HIP-Clang is
transparent and efficient as the HIPCC and HIP cmake files automatically
choose compilation options for HIP-Clang and hide the difference between
the HCC and HIP-Clang code. However, minor changes may be required as
HIP-Clang has a stricter syntax and semantic checks compared to HCC.

NOTE: Native HCC language features are no longer supported.

Radeon Open Compute Common Language Runtime
----------------------------------------------

In this release,  the HIP runtime API is implemented on top of Radeon Open Compute Common Language Runtime (ROCclr). ROCclr is an abstraction layer that provides the ability to interact with different runtime backends such as ROCr.

OpenCL Runtime
---------------------

The following OpenCL runtime changes are made in this release:

-  AMD ROCm OpenCL Runtime extends support to OpenCL2.2
-  The developer branch is changed from master to master-next


AMD ROCm GNU Debugger - ROCgdb
---------------------------------

The AMD ROCm GNU Debugger (ROCgdb) is the AMD ROCm source-level debugger for
Linux based on the GNU Debugger (GDB). It enables heterogeneous
debugging on the AMD ROCm platform of an x86-based host architecture
along with AMD GPU architectures and supported by the AMD Debugger API
Library (ROCdbgapi).

The AMD ROCm Debugger is installed by the rocm-gdb package. The rocm-gdb
package is part of the rocm-dev meta-package, which is in the rocm-dkms
package.

The current AMD ROCm Debugger (ROCgdb) is an initial prototype that
focuses on source line debugging. Note, symbolic variable debugging
capabilities are not currently supported.

You can use the standard GDB commands for both CPU and GPU code
debugging. For more information about ROCgdb, refer to the ROCgdb User
Guide, which is installed at:

-  /opt/rocm/share/info/gdb.info as a texinfo file
-  /opt/rocm/share/doc/gdb/gdb.pdf as a PDF file

The AMD ROCm Debugger User Guide is available as a PDF at:

https://github.com/RadeonOpenCompute/ROCm/blob/master/gdb.pdf

For more information about GNU Debugger (GDB), refer to the GNU Debugger
(GDB) web site at: http://www.gnu.org/software/gdb

AMD ROCm Debugger API Library
------------------------------

The AMD ROCm Debugger API Library (ROCdbgapi) implements an AMD GPU
debugger application programming interface (API) that provides the
support necessary for a client of the library to control the execution
and inspect the state of AMD GPU devices.

The following AMD GPU architectures are supported: \* Vega 10 \* Vega
7nm

The AMD ROCm Debugger API Library is installed by the rocm-dbgapi
package. The rocm-gdb package is part of the rocm-dev meta-package,
which is in the rocm-dkms package. The AMD ROCm Debugger API
Specification is available as a PDF at:

https://github.com/RadeonOpenCompute/ROCm/blob/master/amd-dbgapi.pdf

rocProfiler Dispatch Callbacks Start Stop API
-----------------------------------------------

In this release, a new rocprofiler start/stop API is added to
enable/disable GPU kernel HSA dispatch callbacks. The callback can be
registered with the â€˜rocprofiler_set_hsa_callbacksâ€™ API. The API helps
you eliminate some profiling performance impact by invoking the profiler
only for kernel dispatches of interest. This optimization will result in
significant performance gains.

The API provides the following functions: \* *hsa_status_t
rocprofiler_start_queue_callbacks();* is used to start profiling \*
*hsa_status_t rocprofiler_stop_queue_callbacks();* is used to stop
profiling.

For more information on kernel dispatches, see the HSA Platform System
Architecture Specification guide at
http://www.hsafoundation.com/standards/.



ROCm Communications Collective Library
------------------------------------------

The ROCm Communications Collective Library (RCCL) consists of the
following enhancements: 
* Re-enable target 0x803 
* Build time improvements for the HIP-Clang compiler

**NVIDIA Communications Collective Library Version Compatibility**

AMD RCCL is now compatible with NVIDIA Communications Collective Library
(NCCL) v2.6.4 and provides the following features: 
* Network interface improvements with API v3 
* Network topology detection 
* Improved CPU type detection 
* Infiniband adaptive routing support

.. _amd-rocm-deep-learning-1:


MIOpen - Optional Kernel Package Installation
------------------------------------------------

MIOpen provides an optional pre-compiled kernel package to reduce
startup latency.

NOTE: The installation of this package is optional. MIOpen will continue
to function as expected even if you choose to not install the
pre-compiled kernel package. This is because MIOpen compiles the kernels
on the target machine once the kernel is run. However, the compilation
step may significantly increase the startup time for different
operations.

To install the kernel package for your GPU architecture, use the
following command:

*apt-get install miopen-kernels--*

-   is the GPU architecture. For example, gfx900, gfx906
-   is the number of CUs available in the GPU. For example, 56 or 64


New SMI Event Interface and Library
------------------------------------

An SMI event interface is added to the kernel and ROCm SMI lib for
system administrators to get notified when specific events occur. On the
kernel side, AMDKFD_IOC_SMI_EVENTS input/output control is enhanced to
allow notifications propagation to user mode through the event channel.

On the ROCm SMI lib side, APIs are added to set an event mask and
receive event notifications with a timeout option. Further, ROCm SMI API
details can be found in the PDF generated by Doxygen from source or by
referring to the rocm_smi.h header file (see the
rsmi_event_notification_\* functions).

For the more details about ROCm SMI API, see

https://github.com/RadeonOpenCompute/ROCm/blob/master/ROCm_SMI_Manual.pdf

API for CPU Affinity
---------------------

A new API is introduced for aiding applications to select the
appropriate memory node for a given accelerator(GPU).

The API for CPU affinity has the following signature:

*rsmi_status_t rsmi_topo_numa_affinity_get(uint32_t dv_ind,
uint32_t*\ numa_node);\*

This API takes as input, device index (dv_ind), and returns the NUMA
node (CPU affinity), stored at the location pointed by numa_node
pointer, associated with the device.

Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) is a computer memory design used in
multiprocessing, where the memory access time depends on the memory
location relative to the processor.


Radeon Performance Primitives Library
---------------------------------------

The new Radeon Performance Primitives (RPP) library is a comprehensive
high-performance computer vision library for AMD (CPU and GPU) with the
HIP and OpenCL backend. The target operating system is Linux.

.. figure:: RPP.png
   :alt: ScreenShot

  

For more information about prerequisites and library functions, see

https://github.com/GPUOpen-ProfessionalCompute-Libraries/MIVisionX/tree/master/docs

Fixed Issues
============

Device printf Support for HIP-Clang
-------------------------------------

HIP now supports the use of printf in the device code. The parameters
and return value for the device-side printf follow the POSIX.1 standard,
with the exception that the â€œ%nâ€ specifier is not supported. A call to
printf blocks the calling wavefront until the operation is completely
processed by the host.

No host-side runtime calls by the application are needed to cause the
output to appear. There is also no limit on the number of device-side
calls to printf or the amount of data that is printed.

For more details, refer the HIP Programming Guide at:
https://rocmdocs.amd.com/en/latest/Programming_Guides/HIP-GUIDE.html#hip-guide

Assertions in HIP Device Code
-------------------------------

Previously, a failing assertion caused early termination of kernels and
the application to exit with a line number, file, and failing condition
printed to the screen. This issue is now fixed and the assert() and
abort() functions are implemented for HIP device code. NOTE: There may
be a performance impact in the use of device assertions in its current
form.

You may choose to disable the assertion in the production code. For
example, to disable an assertion of:

*assert(foo != 0);*

you may comment it out as:

*//assert(foo != 0);*

NOTE: Assertions are currently enabled by default.

Known Issues
==============

The following are the known issues in the v3.5 release.

HIPify-Clang Installation Failure on CentOS/RHEL 
--------------------------------------------------

HIPify-Clang fails to install on CentOS/RHEL with the following error:

*file from install of hipify-clang conflicts with file from package hip-base*

**Workaround**: This is a known issue and the following workaround is recommended for a successful HIPify-Clang installation on CentOS/RHEL:

* Download HIPify-Clang RPM. For example, *hipify-clang-11.0.0.x86_64.rpm*
* Perform a force install using the following command: 

::

      sudo rpm -ivh --force hipify-clang-11.0.0.x86_64.rpm




Failure to Process Breakpoint before Queue Destroy Results in ROCm Debugger Error
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When ROCgdb is in non-stop mode with an application that rapidly creates and destroys queues, a breakpoint may be reported that is not processed by the debugger before the queue is deleted. In some cases, this can result in the following error that prevents further debugging:

*[amd-dbgapi]: fatal error: kfd_queue_id 2 should have been reported as a NEW_QUEUE before next_pending_event failed (rc=-2)*

There are no known workarounds at this time.

Failure to Process Breakpoint before Queue Destroy Results in ROCm Debugger API Error
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When the ROCdbgapi library is used with an application that rapidly creates and destroys queues, a breakpoint may be reported that is not processed by the client before the queue is deleted. In some cases, this can result in a fatal error and the following error log message is produced:

*[amd-dbgapi]: fatal error: kfd_queue_id 2 should have been reported as a NEW_QUEUE before next_pending_event failed (rc=-2)*

There are no known workarounds at this time.

rocThrust and hipCUB Unit Test Failures 
------------------------------------------

The following unit test failures have been observed due to known issues in the ROCclr runtime. 

rocThrust

* sort 
* sort_by_key

hipCUB

* BlockDiscontinuity 
* BlockExchange 
* BlockHistogram 
* BlockRadixSort
* BlockReduce 
* BlockScan

There are no known workarounds in the current release.


Multiple GPU Configuration Freezes with Imagenet Training and tf_cnn_benchmark on TensorFlow 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A random freeze has been observed with Imagenet training and tf_cnn_benchmark on TensorFlow when multiple GPU configurations are involved. 

Note: There is no freeze observed with single GPUs.  

There are no known workarounds at this time.


Issue with Running AMD ROCm v3.3 User Mode with AMD ROCm v3.5 DKMS Kernel Module
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Running AMD ROCm v3.3 in the user mode with the AMD ROCm v3.5 DKMS kernel module will cause the following features to be broken:

* IPC import/export, cross memory copy (used by UCX and MPI)
* Experimental GDB support

**Resolution**: Install ROCm v3.5 Thunk (*Hsakmt*) when using ROCm 3.5 Kernel Fusion Driver (KFD). 


Deprecations
==============

Support for hipStreamCreateWithPriority

Creates a stream with the specified priority. It creates a stream on which enqueued kernels have a different priority for execution compared to kernels enqueued on normal priority streams. The priority could be higher or lower than normal priority streams.

OpenCL 2.0 support

ROCm 2.0 introduces full support for kernels written in the OpenCL 2.0 C language on certain devices and systems.  Applications can detect this support by calling the “clGetDeviceInfo” query function with “parame_name” argument set to “CL_DEVICE_OPENCL_C_VERSION”.  

In order to make use of OpenCL 2.0 C language features, the application must include the option “-cl-std=CL2.0” in options passed to the runtime API calls responsible for compiling or building device programs.  The complete specification for the OpenCL 2.0 C language can be obtained using the following link: https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenCL/specs/opencl-2.0-openclc.pdf
