**Support for 3D Pooling Layers**
AMD ROCm is enhanced to include support for 3D pooling layers. The implementation of 3D pooling layers now allows users to run 3D convolutional networks, such as ResNext3D, on AMD Radeon Instinct GPUs.

**ONNX Enhancements**
Open Neural Network eXchange (ONNX) is a widely-used neural net exchange format. The AMD model compiler & optimizer support the pre-trained models in ONNX, NNEF, & Caffe formats. Currently, ONNX versions 1.3 and below are supported.
