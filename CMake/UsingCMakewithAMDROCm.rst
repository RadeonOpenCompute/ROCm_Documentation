Using CMake with AMD ROCm
===========================

Most components in AMD ROCm support CMake 3.5 or higher out-of-the-box and do not require any special Find modules. A Find module is often used by
downstream to find the files by guessing locations of files with platform-specific hints. Typically, the Find module is required when the
upstream is not built with CMake or the package configuration files are not available.

AMD ROCm provides the respective *config-file* packages, and this enables ``find_package`` to be used directly. AMD ROCm does not require any Find
module as the *config-file* packages are shipped with the upstream projects.

Finding Dependencies
--------------------

When dependencies are not found in standard locations such as */usr* or */usr/local*, then the ``CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`` variable can be set to the
installation prefixes. This can be set to multiple locations with a semicolon separating the entries.

There are two ways to set this variable:

-  Pass the flag when configuring with ``-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=....`` This approach is preferred when users install the components in custom
   locations. 

-  Append the variable in the CMakeLists.txt file. This is useful if the dependencies are found in a common location. For example, when
   the binaries provided on `repo.radeon.com <http://repo.radeon.com>`_ are installed to */opt/rocm*, you can add the following line to a CMakeLists.txt file
   
   :: 

    list (APPEND CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH /opt/rocm/hip /opt/rocm)



Using HIP in CMake
==================

There are two ways to use HIP in CMake:

-  Use the HIP API without compiling the GPU device code. As there is no GPU code, any C or C++ compiler can be used.
   The ``find_package(hip)`` provides the ``hip::host`` target to use HIP in this context
   
   ::

    # Search for rocm in common locations
    list(APPEND CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH /opt/rocm/hip /opt/rocm)
    # Find hip
    find_package(hip)
    # Create the library
    add_library(myLib ...)
    # Link with HIP
    target_link_libraries(myLib hip::host)

.. note::
    The ``hip::host`` target provides all the usage requirements needed to use HIP without compiling GPU device code.

-  Use HIP API and compile GPU device code. This requires using a
   device compiler. The compiler for CMake can be set using either the
   ``CMAKE_C_COMPILER`` and ``CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER`` variable or using the ``CC`` and
   ``CXX`` environment variables. This can be set when configuring CMake or
   put into a CMake toolchain file. The device compiler must be set to a
   compiler that supports AMD GPU targets, which is usually Clang. 

The ``find_package(hip)`` provides the ``hip::device`` target to add all the
flags for device compilation

 ::

  # Search for rocm in common locations
  list(APPEND CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH /opt/rocm/hip /opt/rocm)
  # Find hip
  find_package(hip)
  # Create library
  add_library(myLib ...)
  # Link with HIP
  target_link_libraries(myLib hip::device)

This project can then be configured with::

    cmake -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=/opt/rocm/llvm/bin/clang -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/opt/rocm/llvm/bin/clang++ ..

Which uses the device compiler provided from the binary packages from
`repo.radeon.com <http://repo.radeon.com>`_.

.. note::
    Compiling for the GPU device requires at least C++11. This can be
    enabled by setting ``CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD`` or setting the correct compiler flags
    in the CMake toolchain.

The GPU device code can be built for different GPU architectures by
setting the ``GPU_TARGETS`` variable. By default, this is set to all the
currently supported architectures for AMD ROCm. It can be set by passing
the flag during configuration with ``-DGPU_TARGETS=gfx900``. It can also be
set in the CMakeLists.txt as a cached variable before calling
``find_package(hip)``::

    # Set the GPU to compile for
    set(GPU_TARGETS "gfx900" CACHE STRING "GPU targets to compile for")
    # Search for rocm in common locations
    list(APPEND CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH /opt/rocm/hip /opt/rocm)
    # Find hip
    find_package(hip)

Using AMD ROCm Libraries
========================

Libraries such as rocBLAS, MIOpen, and others support CMake users as
well.

As illustrated in the example below, to use MIOpen from CMake, you can
call ``find_package(miopen)``, which provides the ``MIOpen`` CMake target. This
can be linked with ``target_link_libraries``::

    # Search for rocm in common locations
    list(APPEND CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH /opt/rocm/hip /opt/rocm)
    # Find miopen
    find_package(miopen)
    # Create library
    add_library(myLib ...)
    # Link with miopen
    target_link_libraries(myLib MIOpen)

.. note::
    Most libraries are designed as host-only API, so using a GPU device
    compiler is not necessary for downstream projects unless it uses the GPU
    device code.
