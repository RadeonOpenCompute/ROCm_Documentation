Welcome to AMD ROCm™ Platform
=============================

AMD ROCm is the first open-source software development platform for HPC/Hyperscale-class GPU computing. AMD ROCm brings the UNIX philosophy of choice, minimalism and modular software development to GPU computing. 

Since the ROCm ecosystem is comprised of open technologies: frameworks (Tensorflow / PyTorch), libraries (MIOpen / Blas / RCCL), programming model (HIP), inter-connect (OCD) and up streamed Linux® Kernel support – the platform is continually optimized for performance and extensibility.  Tools, guidance and insights are shared freely across the ROCm GitHub community and forums.

**Note:** The AMD ROCm™ open software platform is a compute stack for headless system deployments. GUI-based software applications are currently not supported.

AMD ROCm is built for scale; it supports multi-GPU computing in and out of server-node communication through RDMA. AMD ROCm also simplifies the stack when the driver directly incorporates RDMA peer-sync support.

The AMD ROCm Programming-Language Run-Time 
############################################

The AMD ROCr System Runtime is language independent and makes heavy use of the Heterogeneous System Architecture (HSA) Runtime API. This approach provides a rich foundation to execute programming languages, such as HIP and OpenMP.

Important features include the following:

    * Multi-GPU coarse-grain shared virtual memory
    * Process concurrency and preemption
    * Large memory allocations
    * HSA signals and atomics
    * User-mode queues and DMA
    * Standardized loader and code-object format
    * Dynamic and offline-compilation support
    * Peer-to-peer multi-GPU operation with RDMA support
    * Profiler trace and event-collection API
    * Systems-management API and tools

Solid Compilation Foundation and Language Support
####################################################

•	LLVM compiler foundation
•	HIP for application portability
•	GCN assembler and disassembler

AMD ROCm gives developers the flexibility of choice for hardware and aids in the development of compute-intensive applications.
