AMD ROCm Installation Guide v4.5
==============================================



Overview of ROCm Installation Methods
--------------------------------------

In addition to the installation method using the native Package Manager, AMD ROCm v4.5 introduces new methods to install ROCm. With this release, the ROCm installation uses the amdgpu-install and amdgpu-uninstall scripts.  

The amdgpu-install script streamlines the installation process by:

- Abstracting the distribution-specific package installation logic

- Performing the repository set-up

- Allowing a user to specify the use case and automating the installation of all the required packages

- Performing post-install checks to verify whether the installation was completed successfully 

- Installing the uninstallation script

The amdgpu-uninstall script allows the removal of the entire ROCm stack by using a single command.

Some of the ROCm-specific use cases that the installer currently supports are: 

- OpenCL (ROCr/KFD based) runtime

- HIP runtimes

- ROCm libraries and applications

- ROCm Compiler and device libraries

- ROCr runtime and thunk

For more information, refer to the Installation Methods section in this guide.

About This Document
====================

This document is intended for users familiar with the Linux environments and discusses the installation/uninstallation of ROCm programming models on the various flavors of Linux. 

This document also refers to Radeon™ Software for Linux® as AMDGPU stack, including the kernel-mode driver amdgpu-dkms.

The guide provides the installation instructions for the following:

- ROCm Installation

- Heterogeneous-Computing Interface for Portability (HIP) SDK

- OPENCL ™ SDK

- Kernel Mode Driver

System Requirements
======================

The system requirements for the ROCm v4.5 installation are as follows:

**NOTE**: Installing ROCm on Linux will require superuser privileges. For systems that have enabled sudo packages, ensure you use the sudo prefix for all required commands.
 
 
 Prerequisite Actions
 ---------------------

 You must perform the following steps before installing ROCm programming models and check if the system meets all of the requirements to proceed with the installation.
 
- Confirm the system has a supported Linux distribution version

- Confirm the system has a ROCm-capable GPU

- Confirm the system has standard compilers and tools installed

Confirm You Have a Supported Linux Distribution Version
=========================================================

The ROCm installation is supported only on specific Linux distributions and their kernel versions. 

**NOTE**: The ROCm installation is not supported on 32-bit operating systems.

How to Check Linux Distribution and Kernel Versions on Your System
*******************************************************************

Linux Distribution Information
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Ensure you obtain the distribution information of the system by using the following command on your system from the Command Line Interface (CLI),

:: 

         $ uname -m && cat /etc/*release
         For example, running the command above on an Ubuntu system results in the following output: 
         x86_64
         DISTRIB_ID=Ubuntu
         DISTRIB_RELEASE=18.04
         DISTRIB_CODENAME=bionic
         DISTRIB_DESCRIPTION="Ubuntu 18.04.5 LTS"
         
Kernel Information
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Type the following command to check the kernel version of your Linux system.

::
         $ uname -srmv
         The output of the command above lists the kernel version in the following format: 
         Linux 5.4.0-77-generic #86~18.04.5-Ubuntu SMP Fri Jun 18 01:23:22 UTC 2021 x86_64


OS and Kernel Version Match
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Confirm that the obtained Linux distribution and kernel versions match with System Requirements.
